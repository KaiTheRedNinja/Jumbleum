# Design Your Life

Applying the design thinking framework to your life and career

## Overview

It basically mirrors the design thinking process:
1. Empathize (understand yourself, your values, your interests)
2. Define (define your goals, what you want to achieve)
3. Ideate (brainstorm ideas, potential paths)
4. Prototype (try out different options, eg. internships, projects)
5. Test (reflect on your experiences, iterate on your goals)
6. Repeat steps 1-5 until you find a path that works for you
