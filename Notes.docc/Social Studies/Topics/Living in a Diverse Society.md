Diversity üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàüíÖüìà

## Overview

- What are the factors that shape the identities of people and contribute to a diverse society?
- What are the experiences and effects of living in a diverse society?
- How can we respond to diversity in society?

## Factors that shape the identities of people and diversity

In <doc:Exploring-Citizenship-and-Governance>, you learned that your <doc:Exploring-Citizenship-and-Governance#Sense-of-Identity>
refers both to how you perceive yourself and how others peceive you

There are several main identities that are the target of categorisation when it comes to diversity.
- Race and ethnicity
- Religion
- Socio-economic status
- Nationality

### Race and Ethnicity

Even though race and ethnicity are used interchangeably, they are different.

> Definition: Race: Biological classification of people, which includes their physical characteristics

> Definition: Ethnicity: The culture of a group of people who share the same ancestry customs and traditions that distinguish 
them from other groups in society

A single race may have multiple ethnicities.

In Singapore, racial categorisation follows the CMIO system, which stands for Chinese, Malay, Indian, Others (search as European, 
Eurasian, other Asians)

There are two main ways that Singapore uses this categorisation to make decisions regarding policies related to to race and ethnicity.

#### Group Representation Constituency (GRC)

Established in 1988, it ensures that minority races in Singapore are represented in parliament. A group of members of parliament 
represent the interest of residents in the constituency. At least one of them in the group must belong to the Malay or Indian 
community or another minority racial community.

#### Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP)

It was introduced in 1989 to promote interaction and harmony between different ethnic groups in Singapore. Its main aim is to prevent 
the rise of ethnic enclaves.

The EIP ensures that there is a mix of various ethnic groups in each HDB block, based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore. Since different 
ethnic groups live in the same block, they have opportunities to interact with one another.

#### Issues

CMIO Has some issues regarding how it tends to overlook mixed race families, because it only recognises a member of a mixed race family
as one of the races, which may be inaccurate.

### Religion

Singapore is a multireligious society. Different religions have different beliefs, values, practices and ways of life, which shape their identities.
These different identities contribute to the diversity in Singapore.

Race and religion are somewhat related. For example, 98.8% of Malays follow Islam. However, only slightly more than half of the Indian population 
follows Hinduism, with the rest spread across different religions. For the Chinese, less than half of the population is Buddhist, with the rest of 
them being assorted religions and a quarter having none. Conclusion, race is not always a strong indicator of a person's religion, and vice versa.

### Socio-Economic Status

Defined by the wealth/income of people in a society. Generally, there are less people of higher SES, and they tend to
enjoy more power/luxury than others. It can surface in education, occupation, income, house/car ownership, etc.

The government balances SES in the following categories:
- Students: Burseries, free school meals, school fees subsidy (make education accessible)
- Adults: SkillsFuture (by providing sponsored educational resources/training) (make job opportunities accessible)
- Elderly: CPF benefits (make retirement accessible)

### Nationality

People of the same nationality are generally citizens of the same country and usually live together in a particular geographical area. 
They may also share a common history and language.

## Experiences and effects of living in a diverse society

- Interactions in a diverse society and common space
- Experiences and effects of living in a diverse society
    - Cultural exchange and appreciation
    - Exchange of knowledge and skills
    - Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination
    - Competition for resources

> Definition: Common space: A physical location and/or a social space where different groups of people, interact, 
cooperate, or collaborate with each other.

Example of a common space is the void deck in public housing estates. They provide opportunities for residents to 
meet interact and bond.

When living in a diverse Society, there are generally four things that happen.
- Positive:
    - Cultural exchange and appreciation
    - Exchange of knowledge and skills
- Negative:
    - Stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination
    - Competition for resources

Interacting with people of different races as ethnicities, religions and social economic status allow for cultural 
exchange take place. One outcome of cultural exchange is a deeper understanding and appreciation of customs and 
traditions of Singapore's diverse ethnic groups. One example, result of this is fusion food, where different cuisines 
are put together to create new ones.

A diverse society can also facilitate the exchange of knowledge and skills. Usually this comes in the form of foreign 
investments and companies that come to Singapore and provide skills and training to local employees.

However, in a diverse society like Singapore, there is the possibility of stereotypes, prejudice and discrimination.

> Definition: Stereotype: Generalised association of certain characteristics or assumptions with a particular group of people

> Definition: Prejudice: Attitudes or feelings towards other groups that are not based on reasons or fact. Stereotypes 
and xenophobia are examples of prejudice.

> Definition: Discrimination: When a person acts on prejudiced beliefs by hurting or excluding a group

Finally, inflow of foreigners into Singapore means competition for jobs and infrastructure, such as housing and transport.
This competition, whether real or perceived, leads to tensions.

## Responding to diversity in society

- Citizens and government responding to socio-cultural diversity
    - Responses of citizens as individuals and community groups
    - Responses of government
        - Assimilationist policy and its tensions
        - Integration policy and its tensions
- Citizens and government responding to socio-economic diversity
    - Responses of citizens as individuals and community groups
    - Responses of government
        - A government-financed approach and its challenges
        - A shared responsibility approach and its challenges

Social cohesion refers to close relationships between individuals and groups of people, and the feelings of solidarity 
they have as one unit. These bonds can be weakened or broken when individuals are insensitive, hurtful, or disrespectful 
with regard to diverse differences.

### Assimilationsist policies in France

In countries that adopt assimilationist policies, immigrants are expected to adopt the beliefs and practices of the 
majority group in the host country. Countries like Denmark, Germany and France adopt these.

France believes that the ideal of harmony in society is achieved on every individual, put aside their connections to 
race, ethnicity and religion. France acknowledges the existence of diversity, but believes that the French national 
identity should be prioritised over all others.

For example, in 2004, France introduced a ban of clearly visible religious attire and symbols in public schools.

### Integration policies in Singapore

Singapore uses the integration approach, where minority and immigrants retain their unique identities, while forging 
common ground with the majority group in the host country.

### Managing Issues of Socio-economic Diversity

Sweden practices, a government finance approach to provide social services to their citizens, regardless of socio-economic 
status. For example, healthcare services such as hospital care, medicine and dental care are publicly funded. Tuition 
fees for tertiary education are also fully subsidised for Swedish students.

This heavily government financed approach is funded by imposing high taxes. However, with an ageing population, the 
demand for social services is increasing.

Singapore on the other hand, adopts a shared responsibility approach. Basically what that means is that the government 
subsidise some stuff, but the individual does the rest.

For example, in the healthcare system, there are multiple tears of protection.
1. Government subsidies help reduce the cost to the patient
2. MediShield Life pays for large hospital bills and selected outpatient treatments
3. MediSave helps pay for your or your family's medical expenses
4. MediFund helps those who unable to even afford subsidise bills.
