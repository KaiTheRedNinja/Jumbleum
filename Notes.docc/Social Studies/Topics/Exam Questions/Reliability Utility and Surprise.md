Basically the same question but three times

## Overview

`Reliability` and `Utility` questions are usually identically answered, so you're likely to only get one of these in 
the exam.

You may be provided with a question focus. Make sure you **narrow down** your response so
that it stays within the bounds of the question focus.

For example, "How useful is this source as evidence about arguments for introducing a minimum wage in Singapore"
would have a question focus of "arguments for introducing a minimum wage in Singapore". You would need to therefore
identify arguments for introducing a minimum wage in Singapore in the source.

### Similarities between Reliability and Utility

- Reliability == trustworthy, credible
- Utility == Useful


## Reliability

Reliability is the basis for utility. 

In General:
- reliable        → useful
- not reliable    → not useful

### (Predicted) Marking Scheme: 
- L3 - just the source is analysed, ie. useful only because the author is talking
- L4 - cross referenced to other sources → reliability, ∴ useful → utility
- L5 - cross referenced to agree and disagree source
- L6 - Higher Level Analysis (HLA) → purpose (hidden agenda), contenxt, tone, provenance, bias [not in any particular order]
- L7 - L4 + HLA

> If you don't trust yourself to do HLA, just do L5 if you have time. 

### Cross reference:
- Point: "Source X is reliable as Source Y corroborates it"
- Inference 1: "Source X states that [question focus] is [your inference], as seen in [quote from source]"
- Inference 2: "Similarly/conversely, Source Y states that [question focus] is [your inference], as seen in [quote 
from source]"
    - Note that your inference needs to be AS SIMILAR AS POSSIBLE to each other. If they're similar, try your best
    to make them identical. If they're not, then make them exact opposites.

Make sure that all sources used to corroborate/contradict your point match the question focus.

### Highler Level Analysis (HLA):

Format: 
- 5A's [required]
- Impact → outcome
- Evidence/Experience [required]
- Context [required]

Example: 
- Point: "Source X is useful as evidence for [question focus] *because it is reliable*, as the author provides a 
balanced perspective on [question focus]"
- Positive: "The author points out [question focus] is [positive term], which can be seen by [quote from source]"
- Negative: "The author is even-handed, as they point out [question focus] is [negative term], which can be seen 
by [quote from source]"

For Purpose as HLA: 
- Provenance explained + supported
- Identity → Message → Purpose 

## Utility
For utility,

> Format: "How **useful** is Source X as evidence for [question focus]? Explain your answer."

There are two parts for `Utility` questions:
- Sufficiency
- Reliability

### Utility through Sufficiency

Prove that the source _talks about_ the question focus. The steps to do this are:
1. Point: "The source is usful as the GM of Coca Cola wants the consumers to know that"
2. State the author's message
3. Evidence
4. Explanation

See <doc:Inference> for more details on how to structure this.

According to Mr Seth Tan, you don't even need to write a conclusion to explain why the message proves its usefulness,
just that it _has_ a message. I'm confused too. Note that sufficiency is ALWAYS "useful".

### Utility through Reliability

Prove that the source is reliable. Note that your structure must follow a slightly different format, to link back
to the question focus (utility).:

Cross reference:
- Point: "Source X is useful as evidence for [question focus] *because it is reliable*, as Source Y corroborates it"
- _Inference 1 and 2 are the same as reliability._

Highler level analysis:
- Point: "Source X is useful as evidence for [question focus] *because it is reliable*, as the author provides a 
balanced perspective on [question focus]"
- _Positive and Negative are the same as reliability._

OR, if you wrote the sufficiency part first, you can write the reliability part as:
- Point: "Source X is not useful because it is not reliable"
- Repeat the message from sufficiency
- If you wrote a cross reference (ie, HLA is the third paragraph), repeat the evidence and explanation
- Impact: "So that [audience here] can [intended outcome in terms of audience]"
- Link: "With the intent to [biased intended outcome in terms of the author], the source is not useful as it is not 
reliable"

The reason why this works is because message is the 5As (author, "aims to", action word, audience, anticipated outcome). 
If you did the sufficiency part first, you have _already_ done the anticipated outcome, so you don't need to re-prove the
message of the source. You just need to cite the rest of the 5As, then link it back to the question focus.



### Surprise

> Identifying Expectancy: 
> - context of source
> - identity of person
> - context affecting what the person is going to say

**Not surprised if:**
- Another source corroborates target source's content (eg. "Source X is not surprising as source 
Y corroborates it")
- Target source's author's identity lines up with content (eg. "Source X is not surprising as the author 
is a [something here] and therefore...")

**Surprised if:**
- Another source contradicts target source's content (eg. "Source X is surprising as source Y 
contradicts it")
- Target source's author's identity contradicts content (eg. "Source X is surprising as the author
is a [something here] and therefore...")

There are **two types of surprise question**: One source and two source.
- One source: "Does Source X make you surprised? Explain your answer"
- Two source: "Does Source X make you surprised by source B? Explain your answer"

When you have two source surprise questions, corroborate content between the two given sources FIRST.
After that then you can corroborate content between the target source and other sources.

Format:
1. State cross reference
2. Content (PEE) + Cross-reference (PEE) + Logic
3. Higher Analysis [Provenance, Purpose (Hidden Agenda), Bias, Context]

Strategy:
1. Use sources that you are *surprised by*, if there is really nothing then go to not surprised by. 
2. Use cross-reference and comparison
3. Your conclusion should be based on the **target source**
4. Either do Higher Level Analysis, or compare with another (third) source.

Do not attempt higher level analysis unless you have completed other questions and have time.

#### Higher Level Analysis
Only attempt if you have a lot of time

- `Purpose`: If purpose is different, it is NOT SURPRISING that the content is different (eg. Joe Biden wants to elect
himself, Trump wants to elect himself, different purpose, therefore it makes sense that they say different things)
- `Provenance`: If the author has a track record, it is SURPRISING if it deviates (eg. Trump is known for being anti-immigration,
if he suddenly says something pro-immigration then it is surprising)
- `Context`: If the context contradicts, it IS surprising (do this similar as you would a source)
