How urban areas can be sustainable

## Overview

- Sustainable urban neighbourhoods
- Ecosystem services found in urban neighbourhoods
- Common hazards in urban neighbourhoods
- Building sustainable urban neighbourhoods

## Sustainable Urban Neighbourhoods

### Development

> Definition: Development: The economic, social and political process that improves the standard of living for a 
population
> Definition: Human Development Index (HDI): A summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human 
development

Countries are classified to their level of development based on a combination of economic and social indicators. The HDI 
measures mainly these four factors:
- life expectancy,
- years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more,
- expected years of schooling for children of school entering age and
- GNI per capita.

### Sustainable Development

Sustianable development is driven by these three categories:

> Definition: Economic sustainability: To ensure that all human beings can enjoy prosperous, fulfilling lives and that 
economic progress can occur in harmony with nature.

Economic sustainability can be achieved by
- High population density (money to go around, yk)
- Proximity of buildings and objects
- Transport infra close to each other

> Definition: Social sustainability: To ensure that societies are inclusive and resilient, where residents have a voice.

Social sustainability can be achieved by
- Inclusiveness and sense of place (see <doc:Thinking-Geographically#People's-Sense-of-place>)
- Community spaces (places for the community to meet)
- Small population size (everybody knows each other)
- Provide platforms for residents to voice their opinions and participate in decision making (make the people feel
included)

> Definition: Environmental sustainability: To sustainably manage natural resources and take urgent action on climate 
change to support the needs of present and future generations.

- Ample protection for nature
- Waste minimisation and recycling
- Energy and water efficent design approaches for buildings and landscapes

The approach to these sustainability requirements varies from place to place, and across time. For example, China has 
focused a lot on economic sustainability and largely ignored environmental sustainability.

A holistically sustainable development meets these criteria:
- It meets the needs of the present population by having high standards of living for all.
- Ensures that future generations can meet their needs
- An over-focus on one dimension may lead to other dimensions being overlooked.
- Approaches to sustainable development vary from place to time

## Ecosystem services in urban neighbourhoods

> Definition: Ecosystem: An ecosystem is a geographic area where living communities and non-living environments interact 
with each other to form a bubble of life.

- An urban neighbourhood is also considered an ecosystem
- Everything in an ecosystem depends on each other, directly of indirectly
- Human activities can change an ecosystem either positively or negatively

### Ecosystem Resources

#### Ecosystem Services

> Definition: Ecosystem services: The benefits people obtain from ecosystems to make human life possible. It is 
categorised into provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services.

There are four main ecosystem services:

#### Provisioning Services
> Definition: Provisioning services: Tangible resources that people can get from ecosystems such as food, water, and 
wood.

Tangible resources, eg food, water, timber, fibre

#### Regulating Services
> Definition: Regulating services: benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes including microclimate 
regulation, flood mitigation, and air and water quality control.

Tangible service, eg climate regulation, flood control, air quality. Ecosystem processes work together to ensure that 
the ecosystems are functional, clean, sustainable and resilient to changes.

#### Cultural Services
> Definition: Cultural services: Non-material benefits people obtain from ecosystems and include aesthetic experiences, 
education and recreation.

Intangible resources, eg spiritual, recreational, aesthetic, educational. Activities may improve people’s physical and 
mental health and foster social belonging and group identity, strengthening their sense of place.

See <doc:#Tourism-Development> for more information on cultural services

#### Supporting Services
> Definition: Supporting services: Services necessary for the functioning of all other ecosystem services, including 
soil formation, pollination and photosynthesis.

Tangible resources, nescessary for functioning of other ecosystem services eg soil formation, pollination, 
photosynthesis. Services necessary for the functioning of all other ecosystem services that are necessary for the 
functioning of all other ecosystem services. 

## Common Hazards in Urban Neighbourhoods

> Definition: Hazard: Process, phenomena or human activities that cause injury or loss of life, property damage, social 
and economic disruption or environmental degradation. 

- Fire hazards
    - Impacts: 
        - Health
            - Burns
            - Smoke inhalation
        - Property
            - Destruction of commercial or residential property → economic loss
            - Economic loss → high cost to replace and rebuild what has been lost
    - Causes: electrical, cooking, flammable materials
- Air pollution hazards
    - Impacts:
        - Asthma
        - Lung cancer
        - Heart disease
        - Lung failure or problems
    - Causes: vehicles, factories, burning of fossil fuels, haze
- Traffic hazards
    - Impacts: 
        - Health
            - Injuries, death
        - Property
            - Damage to vehicles
    - Causes: reckless driving, poor road conditions, poor visibility

## Building Sustainable Urban Neighbourhoods

> Definition: Environmental stewardship: Action taken by people or groups to protect, care for or responsibly use the 
environment to pursue environmental and/or societal outcomes

Can be done on any scale, *individuals, organisations, and governments.* It generally encompass the following:
- Seeking to conserve natural resources
- Preserve existing natural environment
- Repair damages and negative impacts caused by humans to ensure sustainability

Environmental stewardship can be broadly achieved through the following:
- Promoting `volunteerism` in neighbourhoods to share knowledge with others about the importance of a healthy ecosystem.
    - The residents know what they can and should do to use and protect the natural environment.
- A partnership of public and private sectors contributing to environmental stewardship efforts
    - Stakeholders have different perspectives, resources and expertise to enhance environmental stewardship efforts.
    - crucial for them to come together

### Disaster Risk Management

> Definition: Disaster Risk: Likelihood of damage to property, injuries, loss of lives from a disaster event

Product of interaction of 3 main factors:
- Nature of hazard
- Vulnerability
- Exposure

> Definition: Disaster Risk Management: Plans and actions implemented to prevent new risks from happening, reduce 
existing risks, manage disaster risks

Plans and actions that are implement to prevent new risks from happening, reduce existing risks, manage disaster risks.
Strengthening community resilience is a key aspect of disaster risk management.

> Definition: Community Resillience: Residents' ability to organise/equip themselves to resist, adapt and recover from 
disasters.

Can be developed by:
- Strengthening relationships between residents
- raising their awareness of potential hazards
- Allowing residents to develop the ability to organise themselves
- Equip them with resources to resist, adapt and recover from a disaster

#### Strengthening of relationships and raising threat awareness

- Disaster risk management plans in neighbourhoods may only be effective and sustain ble if there is widespread support 
and long-term participation from residents
- Residents are encouraged to get to know their neighbours so that they can depend on one another during an emergency.
- Important to take note that neighbour to neighbour relationships are highly diverse, varying from one group to the other, 
and may occasionally cause problems.

#### Developing self-organisation and resources for disaster fallout

Resist, Adapt and Recover

- Residents can be involved in planning process that involve community leaders, civil society organisations and the government.
- By actively participating in projects to minimise potential hazards in the neighbourhood, they can better understand the 
risks and adaptations to communicate to the planners and government bodies.
