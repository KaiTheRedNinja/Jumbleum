# Intellectual Property

IP, licenses, and different types of software

## Definitions
- `Intellectual property` - Creations of the mind that have value but can exist purely as data with no physical form.
- `Copyright` - The legal right of owners to control the use and distribu- tion of their intellectual property.
- `Licence` - Official description of activities that are authorised or forbidden by the owner of intellectual property.

## Types of Software Licences
There are several types of software licences in order to avoid infringing copyright laws.

@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("Public Domain Software") {
        Software where the legal protections that are typically granted to intellectual property have either expired, surrendered or 
        are simply inapplicable. Not protected by copyright, anybody can legally copy, modify and distribute public domain software. 

        It may not always come with source code, though most do.
    }

    @Tab("Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)") {
        Software where users are given freedom to change, copy, study and share the software and its source code.
        
        The term "free" refers to free to use, not free of charge.

        Similar to public domain software, but is still protected under copy- right and the copyright owners may use 
        this protection to require that the software must always be distributed with source code, attribution to the 
        original authors must be provided or any modifications must use a similar licence if distributed.
        
        Other types of copyrighted works such as books, photographs and music can be licensed in a similar manner using 
        Creative Commons (CC) licences. Note that CC licences grant users freedom to copy, modify and distribute copyrighted 
        works, CC licences are not designed for software and should not be used for this purpose. It can, however, be 
        used to license content that is delivered using software. Higher- education course materials such sa videos and 
        notes created by univer- sities and distributed for free on the Internet, aka open courseware often use CC licences.
    }

    @Tab("Open Courseware") {
        Higher-education course materials such sa videos and notes created by universities and distributed for free on the Internet.
    }

    @Tab("Proprietary Software") {
        Commercial software for which most of the legal protections under copyright are retained.

        Unlike FOSS, it is usually not legal to copy, modify or distribute proprietary software. The terms and 
        conditions for which the propri- etary software may or may not be used under copyright protection law are usually 
        communicated to users through an End User License Agree- ment (EULA) contract that the user must accept to use 
        the software.
        
        The source code for proprietary software is usually kept secret.
        
        Although it seems super restrictive compared to FOSS, it is im- portant to remember that software is a form of 
        intellectual property and it is the right of the owner to be compensated for the use of the property.6. An example 
        of proprietary software is Windows OS, where unauthorised copying is illegal and the majority of source code is kept 
        secret.
    }
    
    @Tab("Freeware") {
        Proprietary software that is available for use at no cost.
        
        Some freeware are “lite” versions of proprietary software, allowing users to try a limited version of the software 
        while promoting the full version.
    }

    @Tab("Shareware") {
        Demonstration software that is distributed for free but for a specific evaluation period only.
        
        After the evaluation period, the program expires and the user can no longer access the program unless the 
        user pays a registration fee.
        
        The source code for freeware and shareware is usually kept secret and modifying the software is usually illegal. 
        However, it may be legal to copy and distribute freeware and shareware. Adobe Reader and Skype are examples of 
        freeware, and Camtasia Studio and WinRAR are examples of shareware.
    }

## Software Piracy
Software piracy is the crime of copying, distributing or using proprietary software illegally. Despite being illegal, it is 
prevalent and can take place in many forms.

Installing multiple copies of proprietary software without purchasing addi- tional licences or sharing proprietary software 
with unlicensed users is con- sidered software piracy and can result in similar legal repercussions.

Software piracy causes significant loss of revenue for the owners of intellectual property, which leads to higher prices for 
legitimate buyers.

Cracks are programs that modify proprietary software so that the software cannot detect that it is being used illegally. 
Software piracy is an example of copyright infringement, which is the use or distribution of copyrighted work without the 
permission of the copyright owner. While software piracy is specific to software, copyright infringement can occur for any 
copyrighted materials, such as pictures on the Internet, which is equivalent to theft.

Although all of this sounds extremely based and redpilled, we are legally required to condemn it.

## Plagiarism
Plagiarism is the cat of passing off someone else’s original work as your own, aka the act of claiming to be the author of a 
piece of work without providing proper credit or attribution to the actual author.

Unlike copyright infringement, plagiarism may not always be illegal, but it is nevertheless an act of dishonestly and is usually 
a punishable offence in academia.

Plagiarism can still occur when the original owner of a piece of work consents to letting someone else use it as their own.

To avoid plagiarism, you can use **citations** to give proper credit to the original authors of any reproduced materials in published 
books, websites and articles.
