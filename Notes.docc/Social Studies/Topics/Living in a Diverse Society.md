# Living in a Diverse Society

## Socio-Economic Status

Defined by the wealth/income of people in a society. Generally, there are less people of higher SES, and they tend to
enjoy more power/luxury than others. It can surface in education, occupation, income, house/car ownership, etc.

The government balances SES in the following categories:
- Students: Burseries, free school meals, school fees subsidy (make education accessible)
- Adults: SkillsFuture (by providing sponsored educational resources/training) (make job opportunities accessible)
- Elderly: CPF benefits (make retirement accessible)
