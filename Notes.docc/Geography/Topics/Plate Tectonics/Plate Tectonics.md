## Plate Tectonic Theory

### Parts of the Earth

> ~~Ogres~~ _The Earth_ are like onions. They have layers. ~ Shrek

The earth has three general layers, though two of them have two sub-layers so technically the earth has five.

| Layer | Position | Temperature | Thickness |
|-------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Crust | Outermost | -50 to 50c | 6 to 70km |
| Mantle | Middle | 1000c to 3700c | 2900km |
| Core | Innermost | 4400c to 6000c | 3300km |

### Tectonic Plates

> Definition: Lithosphere: The crust (whether continental or oceanic) and the uppermost part of the upper mantle

The lithosphere is divided into many pieces, called tectonic plates. There are two types of tectonic plates:
- Continental, makes up land masses
- Oceanic, makes up the seafloor

Note that the same plate can be both types at once. The atlantic parts of the African, Eurasian and Americas plates are oceanic.

### Plate Movement and Boundaries

> Definition: Athenosphere: Basically the upper mantle. In O level geography questions, this is interchangable with the mantle as a whole.

Heat form the core causes rock in the asthenosphere to melt. Movement of the mantle results in tectonic plate movement. There are three 
types of plate movement, which lead to 3 types of plate boundaries:
- Divergent: Plates moving away from each other
- Convergent: Plates move towards each other
- Transform (not tested): Plates slide against each other

In the textbook, they put slab-pull force and tectonic processes in different subchapters, after evidence for plate tectonics (which is also 
two subchapters). I find that weird, so they're here in one subsection.

@Row {
    @Column {
        **Divergent**
        - `O-O`, aka seafloor spreading, forms mid-oceanic ridges
        - `C-C` forms rift valleys or block mountains
        - Note that `O-C` doesn't exist, because it turns into O-O divergence. No such boundaries exist.
    }

    @Column {
        **Convergent**
        - `O-O` forms island arcs
        - `O-C` forms volcanoes and trenches
        - `C-C` forms mountain ranges
    }
}

### Causes

#### Convection Currents

#### Slab-Pull Force

### Describing Divergence and Convergence

@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("O-O Divergence") {
        > Mid Oceanic Ridges, underwater volcanoes

        1. Two oceanic plates move apart (see convection currents above)
        2. The decrease in **overlying pressure** causes parts of the **underlying mantle** to melt, forming **magma**
        3. Magma rises through weak areas in the crust to the Earth’s surface and fills gaps caused by the spreading plates. 
        4. The Lava cools and solidifies to form **basaltic rocks**
        5. The rocks make up a new oceanic crust. 
        6. An extensive underwater mountain chain - The mid-oceanic ridge - forms
    }

    @Tab("C-C Divergence") {
        > Volcanoes, rift valleys

        1. two continental plates move apart (see convection currents above). 
        2. rocks eventually fracture to form parallel faults.
        3. The work between these faults collapses to form a deep rift valley with steep sides. 
        4. As the plates move apart, the decrease in **overlying pressure** causes parts of the **underlying mantle** to melt, forming **magma**
        5. Magma rises through weak areas in the crust to the Earth’s surface, forming volcanoes
    }

    @Tab("O-O Convergence") {
        > Trenches, volcanoes

        1. Two oceanic plates collide
        2. The denser plate **subducts** beneath the other plate (see slab pull force above)
        3. This forms a deep depression known as an **oceanic trench**
        4. As the **subducting plate sinks into the mantle**, the **high-pressure** forces water out of its oceanic crust
        5. Water **lowers the melting point** of the overlying mantle, causing it to melt and form magma
        6. Magma rises through weak areas in the crust to the Earth’s surface
        7. This forms a chain of volcanoes known as `volcanic islands`
    }

    @Tab("C-C Convergence") {
        > Fold Mountains

        1. Two continental plates collide
        2. Subduction does not occur because continental plates are too buoyant to subduct (low density)
        3. Enormous pressure causes the rocks to be uplifted and buckled to form fold mountains. 

        Friction along the convergent plate boundary also causes earthquakes. 

        Magma does not rise to the surface, no volcanoes are formed.
    }

    @Tab("O-C Convergence") {
        > Trenches, volcanoes, fold mountains

        1. An oceanic plate collided with a continental plate. 
        2. The denser oceanic plate subjects beneath the continental plate. 
        3. This forms an oceanic trench in the subduction zone. 
        4. Enormous pressure at this plate boundary causes rocks on the continental plate to obe uplifted and buckled, forming fold mountains.
        5. As the subjecting plate sinks into the mantle, the high-pressure forces water out of its oceanic crust.
        6. Water lowers the melting point of the overlying mantle, causing it to melt, forming magma
        7. magma rises through the weak areas in the crust to the Earth’s surface, forming volcanoes on the continental plate.  
        
        Friction along the subducting oceanic plate causes earthquakes
    }

## Evidence for Plate Tectonics

### Seafloor Spreading

> Definition: Seafloor Spreading: A process where the magma from deep within the Earth rises through mid-ocean ridges to create a new oceanic crust
> Definition: Mid-ocean Ridge: A submerged chain linearly located on the ocean floor at a divergent plate boundary.
> Definition: Oceanic Trench: Deep depressions are found in the ocean floor where one oceanic plate is **subducting** beneath another.

1. When two tectonic plates diverge at its plate boundary, seafloor spreading occurs. 
2. Magma from deep in the earth rises through the mid-oceanic ridges.
3. A new oceanic crust is formed. 

If you are asked about why this proves plate tectonics, basically vomit this out:

1. Rocks closer to the mid-oceanic ridge are younger, and those further are older.
2. It shows how a new oceanic crust is created at divergent boundaries and then moves laterally on both sides of the mid-ocean ridge as 
seafloor spreading continues.
3. Little sediment accumulation is found in oceanic trenches. This is due to older oceanic crust being destroyed at oceanic trenches as 
the plates converge and one subducts.
4. Thus, Oceanic crusts are usually younger than continental crusts.
    - This proves that new crust is continually formed at divergent plate boundaries and mid-oceanic ridges as plates move and older 
    crust is destroyed further away at oceanic trenches.

### Magnetic Striping

> Definition: Magnetic striping: A zebra-like pattern where strips of Normal Polarity Rocks alternate alongside strips of reversed 
polarity rocks on the sea floor. 

As the magma cools, it records the Earth's magnetic field. This creates magnetic stripes on the seafloor,
which are symmetrical about the mid-oceanic ridge.

@Image(source: "Diagram_Magnetic Striping", alt: "Magnetic striping")

- Earth has a Geographic North and Geographic South as well as a Magnetic North and Magnetic South.
- Geographic North and Geographic South do not change.
- Over time, magnetic North and magnetic South can shift. They have already reversed many times. (Shown by magnetic striping)
- Currently, the earth is in `Normal Polarity`.
- Over time, Earth’s polarity has flipped many times. Alternating between `Normal Polarity` and `Reverse Polarity`

- The symmetrical pattern on either side of the mid-ocean ridges shows that it is not a random/isolated occurrence.
- Proof:
    - Oceanic plates move away from each other.
    - Basaltic rocks from the oceanic crust are formed from iron-rich lava, which has magnetic properties.
    - The rock solidifies as it cools and its polarity is determined by Earth’s magnetic North and South. Recording evidence of 
    Earth’s polarity at that time. This means that the reversals of polarity are also recorded.
    - Over time as more lava moves from the ridge due to plate divergence, a symmetrical zebra-like pattern forms.
