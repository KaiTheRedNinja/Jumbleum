# Arithmetic Operations

Basic mathematical operations

## Overview

- Explain the concept of Arithmetic operation
- Describe Logic errors
- Describe debugging strategy
- Write simple C program to solve arithmetic problems

## Operations

There are five basic arithmetic operations in C:
- Addition `+`
- Subtraction `-`
- Multiplication `*`
- Division `/`
- Modulus `%`

These operations follow the standard order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

### Type Issues

- Integer division: When both operands are integers, the result is also an integer. For example, `5 / 2` results 
in `2`.
- Floating-point modulus: The modulus operator `%` does not work with floating-point numbers, as its division 
produces fractional results and no remainder

## Logic Errors

Logic errors occur when the program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results. These can be caused by:
- Incorrect operator usage
- Wrong order of operations
- Incorrect variable types
- Missing parentheses
- Incorrect logic

They can be difficult to solve, especially in large programs.

### Debugging Strategy

1. Where is the error apparent
2. Backtrack to find the source of the error
3. Use print statements to confirm values
