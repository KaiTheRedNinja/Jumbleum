more than 30% of curriculum time, your grade will be capped at the passing grade ("D" for 
graded modules, "Pass" for pass/fail modules).

Tutorial assignments are generally not handed in nor graded - however, you should still do them.

A module that starts with `93` are modules that are unique to Engineering Science. A module that starts with `38` 
is a module shared across the School of Engineering.

### PoliteMall

Also known as Brightspace. Usually lesson materials will be made available through MS Teams or [PoliteMall]
(https://nplms.polite.edu.sg/d2l/home). PoliteMall will also be where assignments and quizzes are submitted.
