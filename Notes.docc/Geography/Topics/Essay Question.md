# Essay Question

## Overview

## Format

Basically,
1. Opening paragraph
2. Talk about the given factor/strategy/stakeholder/impact in isolation
3. Talk about another factor/strategy/stakeholder/impact in isolation
4. Balance the two and conclude with a statement

### Opening Paragraph

Either you largely agree or largely disagree. Do NOT write "certain extent". You eithe agree or disagree.

Provide the scope of the essay, like the points you're gonna discuss.

"Although ... there are other factors such as ... that also play a significant role in ..."

### Body Paragraphs

In paragraph one, talk about the factor/strategy/stakeholder/impact *mentioned in the question*

In paragarph two, talk about another factor/strategy/stakeholder/impact that _you_ provide

For both paragraphs, use this structure:

- Explain full how it works
- Provide RELEVANT example with SPECIFIC details
- Provide limitations (if any. Try to think of one)

### Evaluation Paragraphs

1. Reiterate your stance
2. Provide key insights from both paragraphs
    - Holistic, multi-pronged approach
        - Each factor/strategy/stakeholder/impact has its own strengths and weaknesses
    - Context matters. 
        - For example, even if earthquake resistant buildings are effective, it is unrealistic for a developing country 
        to implement it
    - Time frame.
        - Does the factor/strategy/stakeholder/impact work in the short term or long term?
        - Eg. in the short term, it may be more effective to provide immediate relief to victims of a natural disaster,
        rather than focusing on long-term strategies such as building infrastructure
    - Extent of impact.
        - How much does it affect the issue?
        - How far-reaching is the impact?
    - Logic.
        - If A doesn't happen, B doesn't matter

Note that evaluation paragraphs can seem like conclusions. They are not, thats a different paragraph.

It may also seem like a counter-argument paragraph, which it can sometimes take the form of if you disagree with the 
statement.

### Conclusion

- Reiterate your stance
- Sum up the opposition's points
- Explain why your points are more important

## Marks

- Develop arguments that support BOTH sides of the argument clearly
- Use variety of points with good elaboration
- Use examples (if you don't have examples, you're capped at Level 1, 3 marks, aka a very bad fail)
- Evaluation is derived from the points made in the essay
