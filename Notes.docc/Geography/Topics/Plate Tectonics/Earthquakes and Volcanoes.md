## How Tectonics Result in Earthquakes

> Definition: Earthquake: The shaking of the Earth's ground due to the sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere (crust)

Earthquakes usually occur near plate boundaries. They occur when:
1. Tectonics force rock masses on either side of a fault
2. Friction causes them to become locked and stress builds up. 
3. When the stress becomes large enough to exceed the strength of the rock, the rocks snap and/or move to a new position. 
4. This sudden movement causes seismic waves to be released. 
5. An earthquake occurs

Earthquakes are measured using seisometers, in the logarithmic Richter scale. An earthquake of magnitude 6 releases ~32 times more 
energy than a magnitude 5 earthquake.

Because earthquakes usually happen suddenly, they are difficult to predict and scale before they occur.

## How Tectonics Result in Volcanoes

### Different Types of Volcano

There are two different types of volcano: Stratovolcano (sharp, tall, explosive) and Shield 
volcano (blunt, short, mild)

They have different properties:

| Property | Shield | Strato |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Explosion strength | 😔 Mild | 💪 Strong |
| Height | ⬇️ Short | ⬆️ Tall |
| Shape | ⚪ Dome | ▲ Spike |
| Slope | 🎩 Gentle | 🔪 Steep |
| Viscoscity | ⬆️ Higher | ⬇️ Lower |

#### Reason for Differences

Note that whenever we compare the different volcanoes, link it back to viscosity and eruption strength.

Shield volcanoes have lower viscosity lava, due to the low silica content, which allows the lava to flow easily. In 
contrast, stratovolcanoes have higher viscosity lava, due to the high silica content, which does not flow easily and 
builds up around the vent.

**Formation**: Shield volcanoes are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava, which flows easily and
spreads out over a wide area. This creates a wide, flat volcano with gentle slopes. In contrast,
stratovolcanoes are formed by the eruption of high-viscosity lava, which does not flow easily and
builds up around the vent. This creates a tall, steep volcano with a spike shape.

**Eruption strength**: Shield volcanoes have mild eruptions because the low-viscosity lava flows easily
and does not build up pressure. In contrast, stratovolcanoes have strong eruptions because the
high-viscosity lava does not flow easily and builds up pressure.

**Location**: Shield volcanoes are found at divergent plate boundaries, where tectonic plates are moving
apart (less silica, less viscous). In contrast, stratovolcanoes are found at convergent plate boundaries, 
where tectonic plates are colliding (crust melts as it subducts, therefore more silica, more viscous).

### Formation Process: Shield Volcano
Shield volcanoes are formed at C-C divergent boundaries, under similar conditions to block mountains.

1. As the core melts the mantle, heated magma rises to beneath the crust and spreads sideways, resulting in divergent boundaries
2. As continental plates diverge, fractures are formed in the rock layers
3. Reduction of pressure on underlying mantle causes mantle to melt into magma
4. Magma then rises through weak spots/fault lines in the crust to form volcanoes, through repeated eruptions

### Formation Process: Stratovolcano
Stratovolcanoes are formed at C-C convergent boundaries, under similar conditions to fold mountains.

1. As the oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate, the pressure squeezes out the water
2. This water reduces the melting point of the mantle, causing it to melt into magma
3. Magma then rises through weak spots/fault lines in the crust to form volcanoes, through repeated eruptions

### Reason for Different Volcano Explosivity

The explosivity of a volcanic eruption depends on how easily dissolved gasses can escape from the magma

| Factor | High Silica Magma | Low Silica Magma |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Magma viscoscity | Higher | Lower |
| Ease of dissolved gas escape | Very difficult | Easy |
| Pressure build up due to dissolved gas | High, released explosively | Low |
| Explosivity | Violent, explosive | Gentle |
| Volcano Type | Stratovolcano | Shield volcano |

Note that there are exceptions, for example gas may escape through different routes.

## Impact of Hazards

### Earthquake Hazards
Earthquake hazards include:

> Impact: Ground shaking, which can cause infrastructure to crumble

- Destroys Ecosystems (Natural Systems) 
    - Ruptures oil and chemical factories, polluting land and water. 
    - Fractures and uproot trees, causing widespread tree injury and death and damaging wildlife habitats.
- Destroys properties and infrastructure (human systems)
    - Weakens buildings, bridges, roads and railways, causing them to collapse, making it difficult to rescue or supply emergency aid.
- Disrupts services (human systems) 
    - Snaps water and gas pipes, disruption to water and gas supplies
    - Electricity and communication cables break, affecting important warning systems.
- Causes injuries and fatalities (human systems)
    - People trapped under collapsed structures resulting in loss of life and serious injury

For example,
- 2010 Haiti Earthquake, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake
    - Surrounding areas around factories were polluted.
    - Debris polluted rivers
    - Moer than 250,000 houses collapsed due to violent vibrations.
    - about 220,000 people were killed.
    - Water pipes ruptured, causing water shortages.
- 2010 Christchurch, New Zealand earthquakes
    - Many trees were damaged
        - more than 300 had to be removed
        - reduced the availability of habitats for terrestrial species

> Impact: Soil liquefaction, which can bury things like cars. See that mark rober liquid sand video.

- Destroys Ecosystems (Natural Systems)
    - Trees on liquefied soil sink in and tip over, damaging wildlife habitats and causing forest and biodiversity loss. 
    - Liquefied soil may enter rivers and smother aquatic plants, causing them to die. 
    - broken sewage pipes may lead to waste materials polluting rivers and killing aquatic species.
- Destroys properties and infrastructure (human systems)
    - Structures may sink and tip over 
    - This makes it hard to rescue trapped civilians or supply emergency aid
- Disrupts services (human systems)
    - Disruption of Electricity, communication, water and gas
    - Roads and rails above liquefied soil can sink and get damaged, making it difficult to rescue people or supply aid.
- Causes injuries and fatalities (human systems)
    - People are trapped under collapsed structures, resulting in injury and loss of life.

> Impact: Landslides

- Destroys Ecosystems (Natural Systems)
    - Debris can quickly bury large areas of forest and wetland
    - Rivers are polluted, killing aquatic life
    - River blockages, causing floods that damage nearby ecosystems and properties
- Destroys properties and infrastructure (human systems)
    - Destruction of properties and infrastructures
    - Buried villages and farms
- Disrupts services (human systems)
    - Disruption of Electricity, communication, water and gas
    - Roads and rails can be blocked off, making it difficult to rescue people or supply aid.
- Causes injuries and fatalities (human systems)
    - people buried under debris leads to injury and loss of life
    - River blockages, causing floods that drown people.

> Impact: Tsunamis, when earthquakes occur underwater.

- Undersea Earthquakes cause a series of ocean waves (Tsunamis)
- Tsunamis can travel over 1000’s of kilometers

They occur when:

1. Undersea earthquake causes the seabed to be displaced
2. A large volume of water is lifted, forming waves of great wavelength and low height of less than 1 metre. 
3. The waves travel towards land at high speeds around 800km/h. 
4. When it approaches the coast, greater friction with the shallower seabed slows the waves down. 
5. The waves become closer together and increase in height. 
    - The waves can reach heights of 15m or more, travelling at 30-50km/h and devastate shorelines when the waves hit. 
6. Before a tsunami occurs, the sea may recede from the shore as the sea water fills the void caused by the displacement of the seabed (from the undersea earthquake)

They can cause:
- Destroys Ecosystems (Natural Systems)
    - The seawater can flood huge areas of coastal wetlands and forests. 
    - large amounts of debris carried by the waves can pollute these areas, damaging ecosystems and killing wildlife
- Destroys properties and infrastructure (human systems)
    - buildings and infrastructure can be destroyed by fast moving waves
- Disrupts services (human systems)
    - Disruption of Electricity, communication, water and gas
    - Fast moving water can sweep away roads and rails, making it difficult to rescue people or supply emergency aid.
- Causes injuries and fatalities (human systems)
    - people who are swept away by the water or hit by debris may die or be seriously injured

### Volcano Hazards
- Tephra (rock fragments and particles ejected by a volcanic eruption)
- Harmful volcanic gasses (sulfur usually. Cause acid rain)
- Lava flows (literal lava flowing)
- Pyroclastic flows (a dense, destructive mass of very hot ash, lava fragments, and gases ejected explosively from a volcano and typically flowing at great speed)
- Lahars (a destructive mudflow on the slopes of a volcano)

## Benefits of Volcanoes

### Farming with fertile soil
- Over thousands of years, volcanic rocks break down and undergo weathering to form fertile soils. 
- They can produce higher crop yields
- locals benefit from growing a variety of crops or earning more from higher crop yeilds

### Extracting precious minerals and fossil fuels
- Some magma may cool and solidify beneath volcanoes, forming precious minerals such as copper, silver and gold. 
- Locals may be employed to mine these minerals which provides them with a source of income
- Governments may sell these precious minerals to generate revenue. 
    - The money can then be used to provide social services to the locals. eg. education and healthcare

### Harnessing geothermal energy
- Derived from heat in the Earth’s crust
    - hot rocks heat up groundwater
    - steam that is formed is harnessed to generate electricy
    - locals benefit from cheaper electricity produced locally. 
    - locals can also be employed to work in the geothermal power plants
- can be harnessed in tectonically active areas. 

### Tourism Activities
- Tectonic environments can be attractive to tourists
- Different volcanic features like the crater appeal to tourists
- tourists can engage in various activities, such as hiking and sightseeing
- Tourism provides locals with employment opportunities such as tour guides, proving accommodation, selling food and souvenirs
- basically, it boosts local economic development
