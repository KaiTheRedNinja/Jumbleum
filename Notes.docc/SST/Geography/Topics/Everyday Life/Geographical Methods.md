## Overview

- How to design fieldwork (surveying)
    - Research questions and hypotheses
        - identify a topic or thesis from textbooks, news articles, websites
        - craft a question that outlines a specific scope and a measurable hypothesis about one or two variables
    - Data collection sequence through primary and/or secondary sources
        - collect quantitative data, then design qualitative data collection to examine patterns and trends
        - collect qualitative data, then design quantitative data collection to verify observations
    - Limitations and risks
        - adjust research aim, study area, sample size and timeframe according to available resources
        - implement measures to avoid harming oneself, other people and nature
- How to collect primary data
    - Sampling
        - use non-probability sampling methods including convenienceand quota sampling
        - use probability sampling methods including simple random sampling and stratified random sampling
    - Closed-ended questionnaire surveys
        - create pre-defined responses to questions that are limited to short phrases, single words or numbers
        - use rating scales to guide responses including the Likert scale, frequency scale and ranking scale
    - Mental maps
        - visualise experiences by drawing features and adding labels onto the base map of a study area
        - conduct semi-structured interviews with open-ended questions exploring features and labels added to the map
- How to process and analyse data
    - Closed-ended questionnaire surveys
        - interpret responses using measures of frequency including counts and percentages
        - interpret responses using measures of central tendency including mean, mode and median
    - Mental maps
        - analyse how well maps represent reality, and how features and labels are drawn or added
        - examine how memories of experiences are represented on maps and described during semi-structured interviews
    - Relationships and patterns
        - visualise positive and negative correlations using scatter plots and best-fit lines
        - identify recognisable geometric shapes, clusters and repetitions
- How to present findings
    - Maps
        - represent spatial information using dots, lines and polygons
        - provide title, date, orientation, scale, legend, author and source(s) on maps
    - Graphs
        - use bar graphs and pie charts to show distributions
        - use line graphs to show trends and relationships between two variables
    - Photographs and texts
        - use satellite and aerial images to display spatial information
        - use colour-coded quotations and word clouds to represent qualitative analyses

## Fieldwork

> Definition: Fieldwork: Systematic approach to investigating geographical phenomena and its related issues. 

1. Craft hypothesis/research question
2. Data collection
3. Analysis
4. Presentation
5. Conclusion & Evaluation

Research question and hypothesis have some differences:

| Research question | Hypothesis |
| --- | --- |
| A question outlining the specific scope of investigation in relation to the topic | Uses one or two variables to form a measurable statement |
| used when there is little existing research or 
when relationships between variables are uncertain.  | Used when large swathes of information on a topic exists. 
Relationships between variables are quite certain.  |
| Inquisitive in Nature ("What are the impacts of X") | Predictive in Nature ("X will cause Y") |
| Multiple different conclusions can be drawn | A singular definite conclusion can be formed at the end of the investigation |

## Data Collection

There are two types of data, primary (do it yourself) and secondary (someone else did it).

| Primary Data | Secondary Data |
| --- | --- |
| First hand collection of data (personally collected data) | data collected by others |
| photographs, sketches, diagrams taken by researchers.  | Books, articles, journals, maps, all produced by other authors |
| Responses from closed-ended questionnaire surveys | data collected by your team is considered primary data |

These data can be further classified into two types, quantitative (numbers) and qualitative (not numbers) data.

| Quantitative Data | Qualitative Data |
| --- | --- |
| Data that can be quantified and measured | Data not easily measurable and are subjective in Nature.  |

## Crafting Questions

Certain questions are not appropriate for surveys, such as:
- Loaded questions (questions that assume a precondition)
    - "How long have you stopped smoking?"
    - Can cause inaccuracy due to the assumption
    - Should split them into different parts, and make the follow up question optional
- Double-barrelled questions (questions that ask two things at once)
    - "Do you agree that having pets is expensive and time consuming?"
    - Can cause confusion and inaccuracy
    - Should split them into different parts, to separate the variables
- Ambiguous questions (questions that are unclear)
    - "On a range of 1 to 5, how much do you dislike the new policy?" (scale unclear)
    - Can cause inaccuracy due to the lack of clarity, or different interpretations by different people
    - "Is the cake nice?" ("nice" is subjective)
- Sensitive questions (questions that are too personal)
    - "How much do you earn?"
    - Can cause discomfort, reluctancy to respond, and inaccuracy
    - Should be avoided, or asked in a more general manner with ranges

## Data Sampling

There are two different ways of sampling: probability and non-probability sampling. Those are broken down further too.

- Probability Sampling
    - Simple random sampling
    - Stratified sampling
- Non-probability Sampling
    - Convenience sampling
    - Quota sampling

@TabNavigator {
    @Tab("Simple Random Sampling") {
        Each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.
            
        - Pros
            - No prior knowledge
            - ez to get large numbers
        - Cons
            - Not representative
            - Bias
    }

    @Tab("Stratified Sampling") {
        Dividing the population into subgroups and then randomly selecting from each subgroup in a representative manner.

        - Pros
            - Accurate, effective representation
            - Easy to acquire results from entire population
        - Cons
            - Requires prior knowledge
            - Time consuming
            - Logistically not suitable for street surveys
    }

    @Tab("Convenience Sampling") {
        Sampling the population that is most easily accessible, such as your own classs

        - Pros
            - Easy to get data
            - Quick
        - Cons
            - Not representative
            - Bias
    }

    @Tab("Quota Sampling") {
        Dividing the population into subgroups and then selecting a certain number of people from each subgroup, without 
        accounting for the size of the subgroup.
        
        - Pros
            - Easy to get data
            - Quick
        - Cons
            - Not representative
            - Bias
    }
}

## Data Processing

Usually, quantitative data is processed using statistical methods, such as the following:
- Count
- Frequency
- Average
    - Mean
    - Median
    - Mode

To determine relationships between variables, we use the following:
- Correlation (both positive and negative. Basic math terms are acceptable)
- Outliers (data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. See 
<doc:Geography#Describe-Statistics-Questions>)
- Trends (patterns in the data, such as an increase or decrease)

## Data Presentation

- Graphs
    - Pie Chart (percentage)
    - Bar Chart (compare different aspects)
    - Line Graph (changes over time)
    - Comparative line Graph (compare two different aspects over time)

## Conclusion Evaluation

> Definition: Reliability: How repeatable the outcome is
> Definition: Validity: How relevant the results are

For example, if the data sampling is completely biased, its not reliable, but still valid. If the questions are 
irrelevant but the survey is administered correctly, its reliable, but not valid.

If they ask you about this, its usually a 6 mark question.

Other factors that you may need to evaluate are:
- Sample size. Samples under 50 are generally not reliable.
- Sampling method. See above.
- Locations. If the survey was conducted in a place that is not representative of the entire population, the results are
not valid.
- Time. If the survey was conducted at a time that is not representative of the entire population, the results are not 
valid. For example, if you survey about noise at 3am, the results are not valid for the entire day.
