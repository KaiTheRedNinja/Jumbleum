# Parallel Circuits

Circuits where components are connected across the same two points, forming multiple paths for current flow.

## Overview

- Calculate the conductance and effective resistance of elements connected in parallel
    - See <doc:Resistors#Effective-Resistance> for more information about effective resistance
    - See <doc:D.C.-Circuits#Parallel-Circuits> for information about current in parallel circuits
- Explain how current is divided in parallel circuits
- State Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) and apply it to parallel circuits
    - See <doc:Circuit-Theories#Kirchoffs-Current-Law>
- Define open and short circuits

## How Current is Split

In a parallel circuit, the voltage across each "path" is the same. Therefore, we can calculate the current in each path using Ohm's Law:
```math
I_{i} = \frac{V}{R_{i}}

I = \sum_{i} I_{i}
```

Where:
- `$I$` is the total current flowing into the parallel circuit
- `$I_{i}$` is the current flowing through the `$i$`th branch
- `$V$` is the voltage across the parallel circuit
- `$R_{i}$` is the resistance of the `$i$`th branch

If we know the resistances of each branch but not the voltage, we can use the following equation to find the current of branch `$i$`:
```math
V = I * R_{eff}

I_{i} = \frac{V}{R_{i}}
= I * \frac{R_{eff}}{R_{i}}
```

## Open vs Short Circuits

> Definition: Open Circuit: A break in the circuit that prevents current from flowing. The resistance is 
infinite, and the current is zero. The voltage across the open circuit is equal to the supply voltage.

> Definition: Short Circuit: A connection that allows current to flow with little or no resistance. The voltage 
across the short circuit is zero, and the current is limited only by the supply voltage and the internal 
resistance of the source.
