# Programming

Programming, mostly in C

## Overview 

3 Credit Units

A module about programming and its purpose. This module covers fundamental C. It is followed by:
- 44OBOP: Object oriented programming in C#
- 93DSAG: Data Structures and Algorithms in C# (ES exclusive)

Our lecturer says he controls the deadlines, so "don't worry if I (he) push a deadline or lesson back a bit".

## Marks Allotment

| Component | Weight |
| -------- | ------ |
| Practical Test 1 | 25% |
| Practical Test 2 | 30% |
| Project | 25% |
| Classwork | 20% |

Classwork includes practical exercises and TBL discussions (yes, discussions are graded).

Note that the schedule refers to "P{chapter}{letter}" "PT"s and "PTest"s. These are DIFFERENT THINGS, although 
confusingly PT and PTest expand to the same thing. You should know and identify them by their acronym names.
- PTest: Programming Test, carries quite a lot of weight (55% in total)
- PT: Practical Test, carries less weight (5% in total)
- P{chapter}{letter}: Chapter learning exercises, not graded

## AllyLocal

AllyLocal is our module's "IDE" (it is not deserving of that name). It is windows-exclusive, and a bit slow.
