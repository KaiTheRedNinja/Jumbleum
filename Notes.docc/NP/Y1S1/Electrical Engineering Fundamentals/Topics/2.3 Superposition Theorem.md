# Superposition Theorem

A circuit is exactly the sum of its parts

## Overview

> Definition: Superposition Theorem: In a linear, multisource network, the *current through* or the *voltage across* a network element 
is equal to the *algebraic sum* of tme currents or voltages produced by each source acting alone

## Superposition Theorem

Breaking down the conditions:
- **linear**: Ohm's law applies (V = IR)
- **multisource**: The network has more than one source

Mathematically,
```math
I_{T} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} I_{i}
V_{T} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} V_{i}
```

Where:
- `$I_{T}$`: Total current through the element of interest
- `$V_{T}$`: Total voltage across the element of interest
- `$I_{i}$`: Current through the element of interest due to source `$i$`
- `$V_{i}$`: Voltage across the element of interest due to source `$i$`

## Using Superposition Theorem

The steps involved are:
1. Disable all sources except **source 1** (disable means to replace the source with a short circuit)
2. Redraw the network, analyse it to find the current `$I_{1}$` or voltage `$V_{1}$` across the element of interest
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each source in the network to obtain `$I_{2}$` or voltage `$V_{2}$`, etc.
4. Sum the results from each source to obtain the total current `$I_{T}$` or voltage `$V_{T}$` across the element of interest

This theorem is rather simple so I don't think I need to give an example.
