# Hyperbolic Functions

They act similar to trig functions, but are not periodic

## Overview

- even and odd functions
- explain how hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions
- obtain and use hyperbolic function identities
- manipulate expressions involving hyperbolic functions

## Even and Odd Functions

A given function `$f(x)$` can be split into an even and odd part:
```math
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left( f(x) + f(-x) \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( f(x) - f(-x) \right)
```
where
- the first part is even
- the second part is odd

Each of these parts have their own properties:

        ### Even Functions
        Even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. They satisfy the property:
        ```math
        g(x) = g(-x)
        ```
        where `$g(x)$` is the even function.

        This is because when `$x$` is replaced with `-$x$` in the standard form, the function remains 
        unchanged:
        ```math
        \frac{1}{2} \left( f(x) + f(-x) \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left( f(-x) + f(x) \right)
        ```
    }
    @Column {
        ### Odd Functions
        Odd functions are symmetric about the origin. They satisfy the property:
        ```math
        g(x) = -g(-x)
        ```
        where `$g(x)$` is the odd function.

        This is because when `$x$` is replaced with `-$x$` in the standard form, the function changes sign:
        ```math
        \frac{1}{2} \left( f(x) - f(-x) \right) = -\frac{1}{2} \left( f(-x) - f(x) \right)
        ```
    }
}

## Hyperbolic Function Definitions

The hyperbolic functions `$\cosh(x)$` and `$\sinh(x)$` are defined in terms of the exponential function:
```math
e^x = \frac{1}{2} \left( e^x + e^{-x} \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( e^x - e^{-x} \right)

\cosh(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left( e^x + e^{-x} \right)

\sinh(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left( e^x - e^{-x} \right)
```

By definition, when these functions are added or subracted, they yield the following:
```math
\cosh(x) + \sinh(x) \equiv e^x
\cosh(x) - \sinh(x) \equiv e^{-x}
```

They look like this:

## Hyperbolic Function Identities

Hyperbolic functions have similar (but not identical) identities to trigonometric functions. This is
because of their underlying definitions, which are very similar to each other:
```math
\cosh(x) = \frac{e^x + e^{-x}}{2}
\sinh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}

\sin(x) = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}
\cos(x) = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}
```

The main identities are:

| Trig Identity                        | Hyperbolic Counterpart                  |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `$\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x) = 1$ `       | `$\cosh^2(x) - \sinh^2(x) = 1$ `        |
| `$\tan^2(x) + 1 = \sec^2(x)$`        | `$\tanh^2(x) + 1 = \text{sech}^2(x)$`   |
| `$\sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x)$`       | `$\sinh(2x) = 2\sinh(x)\cosh(x)$`       |
| `$\cos(2x) = \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)$` | `$\cosh(2x) = \cosh^2(x) + \sinh^2(x)$` |

Note the sign change in the first identity.

## Other Hyperbolic Functions

The other hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of the basic ones:
```math
\tanh(x) = \frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)}
\text{csch}(x) = \frac{1}{\sinh(x)}
\text{sech}(x) = \frac{1}{\cosh(x)}
\text{coth}(x) = \frac{\cosh(x)}{\sinh(x)}
```
