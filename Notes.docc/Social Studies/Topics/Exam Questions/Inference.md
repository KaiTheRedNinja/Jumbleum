The mother of all skills, you're as good as dead without it

## Overview
Key learning:
- Comprehend and extract relevant information
- draw inferences from givene information

Kinds of questions that use inference: 
- Inference 
- Reliability
- Utility

see <doc:Reliability-Utility-and-Surprise>

> Back to the Basics kids:
> Point Evidence Explanation
> 
> Explanation supports Edicence, Evidence supports Point

> VERY IMPORTANT: 
> Main message has to answer both the Question and the Big Question to get a valid inference, else it may be a valid subpoint (not holistic) or an invalid point (completely wrong). If the BOC is wrong, everything else does not matter, even it the evidence and explanation are valid. 

## Message
### Pictorial Source

**The use of symbols to represent something**, this is why we have inference questions in SS papers.

SS papers tend to use *Photos/Cartoons/Comics/Statistics*, specifically **political cartoons**

##### Use the EPIC framework to Decompose the image:
1. Events (context)
2. People
3. Items
4. Captions 

##### Cartooning Techniques: 
- Symbolism → use of symbols to represent something, ie. hints in the provenance telling you what unlabelled items in the image are. 
- Contrast → in size, colour, numbers, etc
- Exaggeration, Mockery, Sarcasm, Irony, [literary devices/language use] → to make a point

##### Format for message questions:
1. **Point:** The message of the source is that `[Topic from Big Question]` is `[adjective]`, as `[parties involved/relationship].`
2. **Evidence:** From the Source `[evidence from source]`
3. **Explanation:** This is because `[explanation, this has to support the evidence]`
4. **Link:** `[why this is important to the message]`

> One way to check if your point is correct is to see if you **need** multiple parts of the source as support. If you do, your message is likely correct. 


## Inference, Why (Purpose)

Author's purpose is to:
- Convey a message → main inference
- Achieve an outcome → impact on audience
- Address the context → response to the information that cause the author to have this purpose

#### Format:
To get L3/4*:
- 5A's → Author, Aim, Action word, Audience, Anticipated outcome
- Evidence 
- Explanation
- Link to context

To get L4/5-6:
- L3
- Outcome → what the author wants to achieve
- Context → what is happening in the world that causes the author to have this purpose

*I'm not actually sure if thats the mark allocation

### Text Based Source

SS papers tend to use *Articles/Reports/Statements/Speeches*, specifically **speeches**
