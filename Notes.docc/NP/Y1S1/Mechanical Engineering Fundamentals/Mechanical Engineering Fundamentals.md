# Mechanical Engineering Fundamentals

Concepts and fundamental principles in engineering mechanics

## Overview

4 Credit Units

Most of MEFD is covered in SST's <doc:Physics> subject, so certain chapters may just link to that subject.

Each week will have 1 hour of OAL, done BEFORE class. Refer to the schedule to see which Brightspace 
assignment/chapter/etc to complete. There will then be 3 hours of class time, which will be a mix of 
theory and practical work.

## Marks Allotment

| Component | Weight |
| -------- | ------ |
| Common Test | 25% |
| Online Assignments (Brightspace) | 20% |
| Project | 15% |
| Exam | 40% |

You can repeat Online Assignments as many times as you want, but only the highest score will be counted. Only assignments marked with the 100 emoji ("ðŸ’¯") are counted - review questions are not.
