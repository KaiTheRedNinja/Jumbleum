The relationship between people and their environment

## Overview

- Relationship between people and nature in their neighbourhoods
- How people acquire a sense of place in their neighbourhoods
- The relationship between locations in a neighbourhood
- How neighbourhoods are organised in Singapore

## People and Nature

- Local communities and nearby nature areas are dependent on each other
    - People are dependent on nature
        - Oxygen, food, recreation
    - Nature is dependent on people
        - Care/conservation/protection

- Local communities and nearby nature areas mutually affect each other
    - Nature areas benefit people
        - See <doc:Sustainable-Development#Ecosystem-Resources>
    - People benefit nature areas
        - Conservation
    - Nature brings disadvantages to people
        - Wildlife hurting people
        - Natural hazards
    - People brings disadvantages to nature areas
        - Pollution
        - Deforestation
        - Animal testing

## People's Sense of place

People's sense of place in neighbourhoods

> Definition: Sense of Place: When people associate meanings and memories with locations

- It reflects the relationship people have with the place and builds our identity, enabling us to understand ourselves 
and others better.
- Derived from our experience with natural and built environments and our interactions with others at the location.
- different locations hold different meanings for different people

### What affects a sense of place

The sense of place can be built by the following factors:
1. Repeated encounters with objects and people
2. Significant/memorable events at landmarks and gathering places
    - Unique attractions, such as the dragon playground in Toa Payoh

A sense of place may be represented in the following ways:
- Different forms and types of media by individuals and organisations, which reflects peopleâ€™s ideas, memories and the 
significance of the location.
- Shared with others through social media

A sense of place can become very intertwined with our identity. When we see representations of a place we have a sense 
of place in,
- We respond well to representations that agree with how we feel about 
places in our neighbourhood.
    - "Feel good feeling" when you read positive (or even neutral) reviews of a place you like
- Such representations add new layers of meaning to those places by revealing interesting information about them, thus 
enhancing our sense of place.
- Contradictions can cause people to defend the place

## Relationships between locations

### Regions

> Definition: Regions: Areas with similar physical and/or human characteristics

Regions may:
- Vary in size
- Classified according to environmental, human, geographical characteristics
- Sphere of influence of services, events, and objects on other locations in the area

### Spacial Patterns

> Definition: Spacial patterns: Non-random shapes, clusters, geometry, repeated occurences at regular intervals

Services, events and objects arranged in recognisable shapes, geometry, cluster and at regular intervals.

- Spatial patterns reflect `non-random` arrangements that are recognisable as shapes, clusters, geometry, or repeated 
occurrences at regular intervals.
    - Services, events and objects in our neighbourhood are often non-randomly arranged
    - reason for particular things to be located in particular spaces
    - Recognising spatial patterns is useful as it help use understand the world around us.
    - Easily identified on maps where things are represented by points, lines, or polygons,

### Spacial Associations

> Definition: Spacial Associations: Tendency for a pair of services, events, objects to be located nearby

Connection between a service, event or object and another service, event or object.

### Spacial Scales
- Spacial scales in singapore are the following, from largest to smallest:
    - Town
    - Neighbourhood
    - Precinct (groups of blocks that aren't neighbourhoods)
    - Residential unit
    
Spatial hierarchies in Singapore are evident from
    - Nested areas of different sizes begin with a single residential unit.
    - Clusters of residential units form a precinct, forming neighbourhoods that combine into a town.

### Town planning in Singapore
Serves residents and provides for nature at distinct levels of the precinct, neighbourhood and town.

Each town has a town centre, serving as a commercial and social hub for residents living in its neighbourhoods. Spacial 
scales allow for town planning, so that each town is self-sufficient (residents do not need to leave the town for basic 
needs like schools, parks, shops, etc.)

Creates connections and synergies across precincts, neighbourhoods and towns. For example, one elderly precinct will not 
be next to another one.

Town planning:
- Land for housing, industrial, commerical, roads, schools, parks, essential facilities
- Facilities enable each town to be self sufficient
- Provide employment opportunities, complement each other
- Create connections across precincts, neighbourhoods, towns
    - Achieve sustainability by optimising scare land resources to cater to diverse needs
- Also plan for nontypical land uses like military, water catchment, airports
