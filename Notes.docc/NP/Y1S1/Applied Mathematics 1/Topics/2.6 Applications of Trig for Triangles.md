# Applications of Trigonometry for Triangles

We're coming full circle!

## Overview

There are only really three:
- Area of a non-right angle triangle
- Sine rule
- Cosine rule

## Area of a Non-Right Angle Triangle
The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
```math
S = \frac{1}{2}ab\sin(C)
```
where:
- `$S$` is the area of the triangle
- `$a$` and `$b$` are the lengths of two sides
- `$C$` is the angle between the two sides

## Sine Rule
The sine rule is given by the formula:
```math
\frac{a}{\sin(A)} = \frac{b}{\sin(B)} = \frac{c}{\sin(C)}
```
where:
- `$a$`, `$b$`, and `$c$` are the lengths of the sides of the triangle
- `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` are the angles opposite the sides `$a$`, `$b$`, and `$c$` respectively

The sine rule can be used to find the length of a side or the size of an angle, and can be used for any 
triangle

## Cosine Rule
The cosine rule is given by the formula:
```math
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos(C)
```
where:
- `$a$`, `$b$`, and `$c$` are the lengths of the sides of the triangle
- `$C$` is the angle opposite the side `$c$`

The cosine rule can be used to find the length of a side or the size of an angle, and can be used for any
triangle
