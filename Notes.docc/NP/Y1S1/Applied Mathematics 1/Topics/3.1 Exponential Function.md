# The Exponential Function

Basically `$a^x$`

## Overview

- approximate `$a^x$` when x is irrational
- describe the behaviour of `$a^x$`: in particular the exponential function `$e^x$`
- understand the terms exponential growth and exponential decay

See <doc:Exponential-and-Logarithmic-functions#Basic-Indices-Laws> for the basic arithmetic laws of indices.
Follow those laws to simplify expressions involving powers of the same base.

## Aproximating Exponential Functions

Non-integer powers are defined only for the real numbers, and looks like:
```math
a^{\frac{n}{m}} = \sqrt[m]{a^n}
```
where both `$m$` and `$n$` are any integer.

Since all irrational numbers can be approximated by rational numbers, a sufficiently precise `$n/m$` is
sufficient to approximate `$a^x$` for any real number `$x$`

## Behaviour of Exponential Functions

Given two values `$a$` and `$b$` where `$a > b$`, three conditions hold:
```math
a^x > b^x \text{ where } x > 0
\text{and}
a^x < b^x \text{ where } x < 0
\text{and}
a^x = b^x = 1 \text{ where } x = 0
```

## Exponential Growth and Decay

Exponential growth is defined as `$y = a \cdot b^x$` where all numbers are positive and `$b > 1$`.

Exponential decay is defined as `$y = a \cdot b^x$` where all numbers are positive and `$0 < b < 1$`.

Both of these functions will "grow"/"decay" faster than any polynomial function. That is,
```math
\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{a^x}{x^K} = \infty
\lim_{x \to -\infty} x^K a^{-x} = 0
```
For any `$a$` and `$K$` where `$K$` is a positive integer and `$a$` is a real number larger than 0.
