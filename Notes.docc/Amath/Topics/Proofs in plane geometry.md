## Overview

- properties of parallel lines cut by a transversal, perpendicular and angle bisectors, triangles, special quadrilaterals and circles
- congruent and similar triangles
- midpoint theorem
- tangent-chord theorem (alternate segment theorem)

## Parallel Lines

> Definition: Transversal: a line that intersects two or more lines at different points.
> Definition: Perpendicular: the property of two lines where they intersect at a 90° angle.
> Definition: Bisector: a line that divides an angle into two equal parts.

Properties of angles in various cases:

| Property | Abbreviation |
| --- | --- |
| Sum of adjacent angles on a straight line is 180° | Angles on a line |
| Sum of angles at a point is 360° | Angles at a point |
| Vertically opposite angles are equal (when two lines intersect) | Vertically opposite angles |

Properties of angles when a transversal intersects two parallel lines:

| Property | Example | Abbreviation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alternate angles are equal | a = c | Alternate angles, AB // CD |
| Corresponding angles are equal | a = b | Corresponding angles, AB // CD |
| Interior angles are supplementary | a + b = 180° | Interior angles, AB // CD |

> Reminder: Supplementary angles are angles that add up to 180°. Complementary angles are angles that add up to 90°.

## Triangles that are Similar or Congruent

There are *four* tests to determine if two triangles are similar:
- AA test: Two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle.
- SAS test: Two sides of one triangle are in the same ratio as two sides of another triangle, and the included angle is equal.
- SSS test: All three sides of one triangle are in the same ratio as all three sides of another triangle.
- RHS test: Two sides of a right-angled triangle are in the same ratio as two sides of another right-angled triangle.

There are *three* tests to determine if two triangles are congruent:
- SSS test: All three sides of one triangle are equal to all three sides of another triangle.
- SAS test: Two sides of one triangle are equal to two sides of another triangle, and the included angle is equal.
- RHS test: Two sides of a right-angled triangle are equal to two sides of another right-angled triangle.

When two triangles are similar, the corresponding sides are in the same ratio. When two triangles are congruent, the corresponding sides are equal.

## Midpoint Theorem

@Image(source: "Diagram_Midpoint Theorem", alt: "Diagram of a triangle with midpoints")

In triangle ABC, if the midpoints of AB and AC are D and E respectively, then 
- DE is parallel to BC
- DE is half the length of BC

## Tangent-Chord Theorem

@Image(source: "Diagram_Tangent Chord Theorem", alt: "Diagram of a circle with a tangent and chord")

In circle AQP, given straight line TAB is tangent to the circle at A and AQ is a chord at the point of contact, angle TAQ is equal to angle QPA.
