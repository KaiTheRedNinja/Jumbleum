## Structure
### Opening Paragraph
1. State your stand strongly and clearly. 
    - State **AGREE** or **DISAGREE**. Do not write 'to a **CERTAIN** extent' or '**PARTIALLY** agree'.
2. Provide the scope of your essay (main argument/thesis statement)
    - In general, just give an overview of what you will be writing [do this only if you have time]

### Body Paragraphs
- Factor 1 (use the impact mentioned in the question if applicable)
    - Explain the factor
    - Provide examples
    - Explain how the factor affects the issue
    - Provide limitations (where applicable)

- Factor 2 (Relevant to the scope of the essay, usually this is differing to Factor 1)
    - Explain the factor
    - Provide examples
    - Explain how the factor affects the issue
    - Provide limitations (where applicable)

### Evaluation Paragraph
also known as a 'counter-argument' 

1. Reiterate your stand (do not provide your conclusion here)
2. Provide key insights that help you argue your stand

Common Insights:
- Holistic - multi-pronged approach for effective management, each strategy/stakeholder have their own strengths and limitations
- Context - It is too simplistic to just say one is better than the other or one is the most important. 
- Time frame - How effective is it in the *short term* vs the *long term*
- extent of impact - large / small impact?
- Logic - if one happens, does the other happen? (order of events)
