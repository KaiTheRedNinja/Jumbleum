# Electrical Engineering Fundamentals

Lay the foundation in electrical engineering to prepare us for more specialized modules

## Overview

4 Credit Units

Most of EEFD is covered in SST's <doc:Electronics> subject, so certain chapters may just link to that subject.

> Important: Wear covered shoes, and bring your electronics set (multimeter, battery, breadboard, wires, etc). You may not be allowed in otherwise.

Each week will have 1 hour of OAL, done BEFORE class. Refer to the schedule to see which Brightspace 
assignment/chapter/etc to complete. There will then be 3 hours of class time, which will be a mix of 
theory and practical work.

There are no "definition" questions in EEFD, according to my teacher.

> Note: "Online Tutorial" refers to the digital chapters in Brightspace. "Tutorial" or "Written tutorial" refers to the assignments which you have to fill out on paper - however, the questions are on Brightspace.
