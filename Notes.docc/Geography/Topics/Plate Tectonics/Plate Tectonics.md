Plate tectonics is how and why continental plates interact with each other

## Types of Plate Boundaries

Transform isn't tested in the exam, so we're not including it.

### Divergent
- `O-O`, aka seafloor spreading, forms mid-oceanic ridges
- `O-C` forms rift valleys or block mountains

### Convergent
- `O-O` forms island arcs
- `O-C` forms volcanoes and trenches
- `C-C` forms mountain ranges

### Transform

## Evidence for Plate Tectonics
### Seafloor Spreading
In O-O divergent boundaries, magma rises to the surface and cools, forming new crust. This pushes the older 
crust away from the boundary, creating a conveyor belt effect.

### Magnetic Striping
As the magma cools, it records the Earth's magnetic field. This creates magnetic stripes on the seafloor,
which are symmetrical about the mid-oceanic ridge.
