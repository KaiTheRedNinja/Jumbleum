Light lies on the spectrum too! Just a different one.

## Properties of Electromagnetic Waves

- Are transverse waves, made of electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to each 
other.
- Carry no electric charge (ie, are not positively or negatively charged)
- Transfer energy
- Do not require a medium
- Travel at the speed of light in a vacuum
- Slow down when entering other mediums
- Obey the wave equation v = fÎ»
- Obey the laws of reflection and refraction (see <doc:Light>)
- Frequencies remain unchanged when travelling from one medium to another
- The higher the frequency, the more energy the wave carries

The electromagnetic spectrum consists of seven main types of waves, in order of increasing frequency 
and decreasing wavelength:
1. Radio waves
2. Microwaves
3. Infrared radiation
4. Visible light
5. Ultraviolet radiation
6. X-rays
7. Gamma rays

One mneumonic is "Raging Martians Invade Venus Using X-ray Guns". Another arguably easier to remember
mnemonic is from Sean, "Real Men Inject [drug starting with V] Until X-plosive Growth"

Remember that gamma rays have the most energy (therefore highest frequency), and radio has the least
energy (lowest frequency).

## Applications of Electromagnetic Waves

| f/Hz | Component | Uses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 3x10^3 to 3x10^9 | Radio waves | Radio and TV, navigation, radar |
| 3x10^9 to 3x10^11 | Microwaves | Microwave ovens, satellite communication. Highly penetrative and information-dense |
| 3x10^11 to 4x10^14 | Infrared radiation | Remote controls, thermal imaging, thermometers |
| 4x10^14 to 8x10^14 | Visible light | Vision, photography, literally everything you use your eyes for |
| 8x10^14 to 3x10^16 | Ultraviolet radiation | Sterilisation, tanning, black lights |
| 3x10^16 to 3x10^18 | X-rays | Medical imaging, security scanning, forge detection |
| 3x10^18 to 3x10^22 | Gamma rays | Cancer treatment, sterilisation, food irradiation. Emmitted during radioactive decay, see <doc:Radioactivity> |

## Effects of EM Waves

> Definition: Ionising radiation: Radiation that has the nergy to ionize atoms or molecules by removing electrons from them

High energy EM waves (any above visible light) are ionising radiation.

Exposure to ionising radiation can result in:
- Abnormal cell division
- Deformities in developing fetus
- Cancer
- Premature ageing
- Shortening of lifespan

See <doc:Thermal-Processes#Radiation> under thermal physics for information on how infrared radiation can heat things up
