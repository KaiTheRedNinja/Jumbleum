The rules that lines within circles follow

## Overview

- symmetry properties of circles:
  - equal chords are equidistant from the centre
  - the perpendicular bisector of a chord passes through the centre
  - tangents from an external point are equal in length
  - the line joining an external point to the centre of the circle bisects the angle between the tangents
- angle properties of circles:
  - angle in a semicircle is a right angle
  - angle between tangent and radius of a circle is a right angle
  - angle at the centre is twice the angle at the circumference
  - angles in the same segment are equal
  - angles in opposite segments are supplementary
