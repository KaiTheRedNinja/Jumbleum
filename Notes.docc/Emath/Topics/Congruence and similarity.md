When shapes are the same but different, or similar enough to be considered the same but still different.

## Overview

- congruent figures and similar figures
- properties of similar triangles and polygons:
  - corresponding angles are equal
  - corresponding sides are proportional
- enlargement and reduction of a plane figure
- scale drawings
- properties and construction of perpendicular bisectors of line segments and angle bisectors
- determining whether two triangles are 
  - congruent
  - similar
- ratio of areas of similar plane figures
- ratio of volumes of similar solids
- solving simple problems involving similarity and congruence
