# Expository

Argumentative, basically

## Overview

Expository writing is mainly about discussing or convincing an audience about your stance on a topic.

When coming up with experience, use a MICRO to MACRO transition. Use MORE examples than experiences.

Make sure that your examples are coherent, cohesive and critical
- Coherent: Ideas are logical and relevant
- Cohesive: effective use of transitional words to make connections between ideas
- Critical:
    - clear understanding of the complexity of the issue,
    - well-elaborated with details (explanation / examples / experiences),
    - details are well-explained and presents a fair and objective view

## Things to include
Rhetorical appeals:
- Pathos: emotions
- Ethos: credibility
- Logos: logic

Modes of reasoning:
- Cause/effect: why something happened
- Comparative: how something is similar or different
- Conditional: what would happen if
- Deductive: Back up a general statement with specific examples
- Inductive: Making general conclusions based off specific examples
- Abductive: Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth

Types of support:
- Personal experience
- Anecdotes
- Case study
- Statistics
- Fact
- Research

## Format

1. Introduction
2. Body (minimum 3 paragraphs of IAEL)
    - IAEL:
        - Idea (point/claim/topic)
        - Analysis (why its important)
        - Evidence (example, see above)
        - Elevation (how your analysis and evidence relate to the idea)
        - Link (why your idea matters to the topic)
3. Conclusion

See <doc:Assertion#Writing-Paragraphs> for more information about Elevantion and Link, because its very similar 
to the BSA (because, so, as a result) method that SS uses

When analysing the question, read the essay prompt twice before identifying:
- The TASK words, which define what you have to do.
- The TOPIC words, which define what you should focus on.
- The CONTEXTUAL words, which define the limits of your discussion.
These three sets of keywords enable you to stay on task, i.e., organised and relevant.

For example, in the following:
- Describe the three qualities that are most important for you in a student leader. [SST Prelims 2023 Q3]
    - Task: Describe
    - Topic: Qualities of a student leader
    - Contextual: Qualities
2. 'Schools should teach practical skills such as cooking and managing our finances.' Do you agree? Why or why not?
[GCE O Levels 2023 Q5]
    - Task: Agree/Disagree
    - Topic: Schools teaching practical skills
    - Contextual: Cooking and managing finances
3. 'All you need to succeed in life is a positive attitude.' How far would you agree? [GCE O Levels 2023 Q6]
    - Task: How far would you agree
    - Topic: Success in life
    - Contextual: Positive attitude
4. 'People can only be happy if they feel they are treated fairly'. Do you agree? [GCE O Levels 2019]
    - Task: Agree/Disagree
    - Topic: Can only be happy if they feel they are treated fairly
    - Contextual: People being happy and fair

## Meeting Question Requirements

Determine exactly what the topic would entail. For example, for the third one, you'd need to:
1. Define 'success in life' and 'positive attitude'
2. Consider what are the different factors/ components that need to come together to achieve this 'success' (Context)
3. Think about the role a 'positive' attitude' plays in ensuring this 'success' under different circumstances (Thesis)
4. What are the circumstances when a 'positive attitude' is all that is needed?
5. What are the circumstances when a 'positive attitude is not enough?

More generally, you need to:
1. Define the terms in the question (summarise this in the intro)
2. Consider different factors in the condition (introduce this in each of the points)
3. Consider the role of the condition in the factors (body of each point)
4. Balance the factors (conclusion paragraph)
