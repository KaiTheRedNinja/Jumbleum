How to not disaster as disastrously

## Overview

- Disaster risk management in the context of sustainable development
- Disparity between impacts of tectonic hazards
- Effectiveness of community resilience strategies

## What does Disaster Management Mean

> Definition: Disaster Risk: The potential damage to properties, injuries and loss of lives form a disaster in a given period of time.

Disaster Risk is determined from the product of the interaction between tectonic hazard, vulnerability and exposure. See 
<doc:Sustainable-Development#Disaster-Risk-Management> in sustainable development for more information about disaster risks.

> Definition: Disaster Risk Management: The plans and actions that are put in place to prevent, reduce and manage disaster risks before, 
during and after the occurrence of tectonic hazards

- Before: Designing hazard resistance buildings to ensure structures can withstand hazards and do not collapse easily.
- During: Tsunami and earthquake early monitoring and warning systems. → timely evacuation and reduction in potential loss of life.
- After: Insurance coverage for financial payouts to rebuild when properties are damaged or destroyed. → quicker recovery from impacts of a tectonic hazard.

### Impacts of Disasters

Disasters can cause environmental, social, and economic consequences.

### Environmental Consequences

- Landslides caused by volcanic eruptions can bury large forest areas, wetlands and areas.
    - Destruction of ecosystems and loss of biodiversity
- Debris pollutes rivers
    - Death of aquatic life
    - Causes floods due to blockage

### Social Consequences

- Tsunamis result in injuries and loss of life
- People become homeless
    - temporary housing lacks proper sanitation → poor quality of life
- contamination of food and water sources → bacterium
- Psychological trauma from the loss of homes or loved ones
    - PTSD in a nutshell

### Economic Consequences

- Destruction of property
- Financially affected due to rebuilding
- Governments have to spend large amounts of money to repair and rebuild damage caused

## What Affects the Impact of a Disaster

There are two things that affect the impact of a disaster: the nature of the hazard and the vulnerability of the community. The nature of the
hazard refers to how strong/long the hazard is, while the vulnerability of the community refers to the state of the infrastructure/community.

The nature of a hazard are generally things that cannot be controlled. Vulnerability, however, can be controlled. This is why disaster risk
management is so important.

### Factors for Earthquake Disaster Risk

#### Duration of Shaking

- length of time of ground shaking can influence the extent of disaster risks.
- The longer the duration → the more damaging
    - The 2011 Tohuku, Japan earthquake (magnitude of 9.0) laseted for 6 minutes. Causing massive damage to structures.

#### Time of day

The time of day influences the activities carried out by people and how they respond when the earthquake strikes.

- Asleep = less likely to respond/evacuate as quickly
- Day time = opposite of asleep :P
    - The 1995 Kobe, Japan earthquake (magnitude of 6.9) occurred in the early morning around 6am.
    - Many people were asleep and trapped at home, leading to more than 6000 lives lost

### Factors for Earthquake Vulnerability

#### Quality of building design and construction

In general, the earthquake does not kill people, the structures around them do

- Poor quality of building design = more likely of building to collapse.
- Buildings are poorly made when:
    - Low-quality materials
    - Non-compliant with building codes set by authorities
    - lack earthquake-resistant features like reinforced steel walls.
- During the 2010 (magnitude 7) earthquake that occurred in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, many buildings and infrastructure collapsed.
- The buildings in Haiti are made of poor-quality materials and the concrete pillars holding up the buildings are poorly reinforced.
- More than 90% of all buildings near the epicentre were destroyed during the earthquake
    - more than 220 000 lives were lost

#### Soil and Rock Properties

- When the solid is saturated and loose, shaking may result in liquefaction.
    - Structures are vulnerable as they may sink into the liquefied solid and tip over.
- The softer the soil the higher the disaster risks
    - This is why reclaimed land is made to settle down for a few years before making major developments.
- seismic waves travelling form hard rocks to soft soil become amplified.
    - Passing from rock to soil, the waves slow down but become bigger
    - soft, loose soil shakes more intensely compared to hard rock, increasing the likelihood of buildings and bridges collapsing.

### Factors for Volcano Disaster Risk

- Chemical composition affects the nature of the eruption
- Type of magma determines if the eruption is explosive or effusive

For low silica magma,
- More gentle eruption
- Damaging to infrastructure and properties over large areas within the geographic region of the volcano
- rarely kills as people usually can avoid the path of the lava

For high silica magma,
- May kill due to highly destructive pyroclastic flows
- explosion of volcanic materials may strike people and properties, resulting in injuries and loss of life

### Factors for Volcano Vulnerability

## Influence of Vulnerable Conditions

### Availability of water

- more water → more likelihood of lahars occurring
- Increases the vulnerability of people and property.
- large quantities of water may come from a range of sources
    - Rapid melting of snow and ice on the volcano’s summit just before or during an eruption
    - Groundwater released through cracks and fractures during an eruption
    - existing rivers or lakes
    - Heavy rainfall

### Wind Conditions

Strength and direction of winds affect the distribution of ashfall and tephra

- Ashfall and tephra may fall in human settlements, affecting the extent of disaster risks.

- The larger the areas affected, the higher the number of people and properties that become vulnerable.
    - Heavier and larger particles are deposited closer to the volcano
    - Finer and lighter ash particles may be carried and deposited very far from the volcano
    - People will likely experience health issues, mainly respiratory
    - Properties may be damaged when the weight of the ash accumulated on roofs causes them to cave
    - Farmland and crops may be destroyed.

## Building Resilience

Note that this is usually called "community preparedness" or "community resillience". Do not mix them up with _preparedness_, a 
strategy under this umbrella. Community preparedness refers to all of these methods.

> Definition: Community Resilience: The ability of a community to resist, adapt to, and recover from the impacts of disasters promptly and efficiently. 

### Land Use Planning

> Definition: Land use planning: Organising and regulating land use and development in an area

Aims to reduce the community’s exposure to tectonic hazards by controlling and minimising development in high-risk areas.

- Decreases potential loss of lives and damage to properties
- Strict guidelines to control development are implemented using hazard maps.
- Hazard maps identify areas at risk and use data on past earthquakes
    - indicate the likely extent of disasters
    - suggest high areas of risk based on the likelihood of the disaster occurring

### Hazard Resistant Buildings

Earthquake-resistant building designs that can withstand ground shaking include
- using shock absorbers or dampeners in buildings to absorb vibrations
- Reinforced buildings using diagonal cross braces to retain building shape during earthquake events.

These prevent buildings from swaying too much, reducing their vulnerability to collapse. Less collapsing buildings means less loss of life and property.

### Early Warning Systems

> Definition: Monitoring and warning systems: A set of devices used to detect seismic waves and ground deformation that can help make predictions and 
send warnings about potential hazards

Monitoring and warning systems are devices used to detect seismic waves and ground deformation. It helps to make predictions and sends warnings about potential hazards.

- Warning enables people to evacuate to a safer place, reducing their susceptibility to tectonic hazards.
- Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) systems use a network of sensors and monitors
    - seismic waves are detected during an earthquake
    - alerts are sent to smart devices to inform people when the seismic waves might reach them. provide warning to people/
    - critical for saving lives as it gives time for authorities and people to respond and evacuate quickly
    - Earthquake sensors identify risk areas, allowing aid to be directed where it is most needed

### Preparedness

Knowing what to do in the event of a tectonic hazard so that the community can avoid the dangers associated with the hazards. 

| Strategy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Raising public awareness of hazards through education | It provides people with the knowledge of the hazards and how to respond to them. |
| First-Aid Training | It enables people to administer basic medical care to the injured and keep them mobile so that they can evacuate if needed.  |
| Conducting of evaluation drills | It enables people to be familiar with evacuation procedures and routes.  |

Increasing preparedness also includes developing plans to ensure people can return to their lives as soon as possible. These include plans for makeshift 
shelters, medical care provisions, food and water.

## Managing Fallout

### Search and Rescue

- Finding and saving survivors trapped in disaster zones
- Rescue the largest number of people in the shortest time with minimal risk to rescuers
- Skilled rescuers and specialised equipment such as heat sensors and listening devices can reduce the time taken to locate and evacuate survivors
- Without search and rescue, survivors would otherwise die from injuries, crush syndrome, dehydration, burns or other conditions

### Evacuation

> Definition: Evacuation: Moving people away from areas at risk of hazards as quickly as possible to safer locations to reduce loss of lives

**Earthquakes**

- Buildings and structure collapse
    - Evacuate people to open spaces
- Powerful aftershocks after an earthquake
    - Buildings and structures already weakened form initial shaking may collapse due to aftershocks, trapping people who are still in them.
- Disruption of basic services
    - People need to be evacuated to temporary shelters where food, water and medical supplies are provided

**Tsunamis**

- People need to be evacuated to higher ground and away from the coast

**Volcanos**

- Lahars, pyroclastic flows, lava flows and tephra can cause loss of lives
    - People need to be evacuated from the danger zone around the volcano

### Provision of Basic Needs

#### Water

- Water shortages after disasters
    - Earthquakes that rupture water pipes cutting off or contaminating water supplies
- Volcanic ash polluting water sources
- Providing clean water can prevent dehydration or water-borne diseases, which may occur when affected parties drink from contaminated water sources.

#### Food

- After disasters, there may be food shortages
- people may not have access to food due to shop closures and/or damage to agricultural crops
- Available food may not be safe for consumption
- Frozen food may turn bad due to damaged storage equipment
- The provision of food can prevent hunger and starvation

#### Healthcare

- Disruption of healthcare services due to damage to hospitals
- Many require healthcare support after disasters
- Access to medicine, doctors, and hospitals can prevent the spread of diseases and save the lives of the injured.

#### Psychosocial services

- Trauma from a disaster due to severe injury, loss of close relatives and friends, homelessness or the loss of livelihood
- Survivors need counselling from mental health experts to come to terms with the disaster and rebuild their lives for the future.
- The provision of psychological services helps survivors cope with psychological trauma, which can last for a long time after the disaster.

## Challenges in Implementation

### Extent of Resources

- lack of resources, including technological and financial resources, may cause challenges in building community resilience
- It may influence the ability of the community to reduce vulnerability and exposure to tectonic hazards and to recover from the impacts of disasters.
- Developing countries often lack the resources to build community resilience.
    - The Governments may prioritise economic development instead of preparing for and dealing with tectonic disasters.

### Capability of Community to Organise

- Lack of community capability to organise itself may result in challenges in building community resilience.
- Limit the community’s ability to respond and recover from tectonic disasters
    - There is a lack of effort to train the community to respond and recover from tectonic disasters.
    - Political instability → civil unrest
    - Corruption leads to loss of funding meant to build community preparedness.
- Difficulties in getting stakeholders to collaborate with the authorities to integrate disaster management strategies into their practices. 
- Disagreements from other stakeholders on disaster management strategies
- Stakeholders underestimate or lack awareness of the disaster risks and the need for certain disaster management strategies
- high cost of integrating disaster management strategies into practicality
    - local communities may be reluctant to purchase insurance for tectonic disaster risks due to the high costs.
    - Private insurance companies might not be willing to offer such insurance policies because of the high financial commitment required.
    - Reluctance to retrofit buildings to ensure they are hazard-resistant because of the high cost involved.
