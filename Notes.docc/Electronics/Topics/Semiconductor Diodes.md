I allow current one way, but I am very prejudiced against the other... only death will stop me

## Overview
- Diode Composition
- Diode Models
- Rectifier Circuits
- Zener Diodes 
    (I'm a diode that can be scared off... death is too much for me)

## Composition
Diodes have 2 kinds of silicon within:
- P-Type (+ve)
- N-Type (-ve)

### Ideal Model


### Practical Model



## Rectifier
AC rectifier

Pulsating DC when a capacitor is added in parallel with the Diode / Voltage Regulator. 
The capacitor is called a smoothing capacitor.
