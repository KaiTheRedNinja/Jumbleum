## Source Based Question

When answering source based questions, always remember to:

1. Analyse the question requirements
    - Pay attention to the **specific requirements** of the question and answer directly.
2. Repeat the question focus
    - Restate the question focus in your answer to convince the marker that you're answering the question
3. Take a firm stand
    - If the question requires you to take a stance, do it **AT THE START OF THE ANSWER**
    - Do NOT use vague words like "to a large extent". You either agree or disagree.
4. Highlight ideas based on the big question
    - The key ideas (eg. the inference in an inference question) usually answer an aspect of the big 
    question
    - Use the big question to determine the main point of the source
5. Fully explain your logic
    - Any leaps of logic will be marked down. Make sure to explain your reasoning fully, for example:
        - "this makes the base source reliable, and hence it is usefulâ€¦"
        - "because of X, so Y, and as a result Z" (BSA)
6. If an SBQ doesn't seem to match any of the common SBQ types, see which one its most like and follow 
that structure
    - Make sure that your answer isn't overly formulaic

### Inference

### Comparison

### Reliability/Utility
These questions are usually identically answered, so you're likely to only get one of these in the exam.

For utility, you may be provided with a question focus. Make sure you **narrow down** your response so
that it stays within the bounds of the question focus.

> Format: "How useful is Source X as evidence for [question focus]? Explain your answer."

Cross reference:
- Point: "Source X is useful as evidence for [question focus] *because it is reliable*, as Source Y corroborates it"
- Inference: "Source X states that [question focus] is [your inference], as seen in [quote from source]"

Highler level analysis:
- Point: "Source X is useful as evidence for [question focus] *because it is reliable*, as the author provides a 
balanced perspective on [question focus]"
- Positive: "The author points out [question focus] is [positive term], which can be seen by [quote from source]"
- Negative: "The author is even-handed, as they point out [question focus] is [negative term], which can be seen 
by [quote from source]"

Make sure that all sources used to corroborate/contradict your point match the question focus.

### Surprise
Not surprised if:
- Another source corroborates target source's content (eg. "Source X is not surprising as source 
Y corroborates it")
- Target source's author's identity lines up with content (eg. "Source X is not surprising as the author 
is a [something here] and therefore...")

Surprised if:
- Another source contradicts target source's content (eg. "Source X is surprising as source Y 
contradicts it")
- Target source's author's identity contradicts content (eg. "Source X is surprising as the author
is a [something here] and therefore...")

There are two types of surprise question: One source and two source.
- One source: "Does Source X make you surprised? Explain your answer"
- Two source: "Does Source X make you surprised by source B? Explain your answer"

When you have two source surprise questions, corroborate content between the two given sources FIRST.
After that then you can corroborate content between the target source and other sources.

Format:
```
1. State cross reference
2. Content (PEE) + Cross-reference (PEE) + Logic
3. Higher Analysis [Provenance, Purpose (Hidden Agenda), Bias, Context]
```

Strategy:
1. First use sources that you are *surprised by*
2. Use cross-reference and comparison
3. Your conclusion should be based on the **target source**
4. Either do Higher Level Analysis, or compare with another source.

Do not attempt higher level analysis unless you have completed other questions and have time.

#### Higher Level Analysis
Only attempt if you have a lot of time

- `Purpose`: If purpose is different, it is NOT SURPRISING that the content is different (eg. Joe Biden wants to elect
himself, Trump wants to elect himself, different purpose, therefore it makes sense that they say different things)
- `Provenance`: If the author has a track record, it is SURPRISING if it deviates (eg. Trump is known for being anti-immigration,
if he suddenly says something pro-immigration then it is surprising)
- `Context`: If the context contradicts, it IS surprising (do this similar as you would a source)

### Assertion
Format: "'[some statement]'. Using the sources in this case study, explain how far you would agree with the statement"

Write FOUR paragraphs, in an `ADAD` format where `A` is agree and `D` is disagree.

Categorise sources into agree/disagree. You are allowed to use a source in both agree and disagree paragraphs, but 
make sure that they are in different paragraphs. Do not use a visual source for both agree and disagree paragraphs.

Do NOT write a summary paragraph. It isn't worth the risk because its not very mark-rich and time is tight.

Use BSA
- Because of [summary of what source said]
- So [connection inference ]
- As a result, [link to statement]
