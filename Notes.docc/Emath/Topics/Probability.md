Wishing you didn't learn probability because your odds aren't good

## Overview
> Probability: The measure of chance

Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. 
It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating an impossible event and 1 indicating a certain event.
In almost any event, (0 < Probability < 1) so if you get a negative number of a value larger than 1... you probably messed up somewhere.

## Probability of an Event
```math
P(E) = \dfrac{\text{Desired Outcomes, } E}{\text{Total Possible Outcomes}}
```

> Unbiased Events: when an outcome is equally likely to occur as any other outcome.

> Biased Events: whent he probability of an event happening is not equally likely. 

## Properties of Probability

> Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes of a probability experiment.

> Possibility Diagram: Used only for 2 events with many outcomes. 

> Tree Diagram: Used to list diffreent oucomes at the end of the branches and the probability of each outcome. 
> 
> It can be used for more than 2 events with few outcomes for each event. **The sum of the probabilities on the branches from the same point is 1**

#### Rules: 
- *P(Sample space) = 1*     ⇨ The sum of all possible events is 1
- *P(definite Event) = 1*   ⇨ The event will definitely occur
- *P(impossble Event) = 0*  ⇨ The event will never occur
- *0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1*            ⇨ The probability of an event is always between 0 and 1
- *P(E') = 1 - P(E)*        ⇨ P(E') is the probability that the event does not occur. 

- **Mutually Exclusive** (Addition): 
```math
P(\text{A or B}) = P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
```
- **Independent Events** (Multiplication):
```math
P(\text{A and B}) = P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)
```
