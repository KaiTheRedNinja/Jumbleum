# Workshop 2 So Dramatic

(In-Person) Using drama techniques to make yourself more confident

## Overview

Exercises:
- Breathing
- Projection
- Body awareneness
- Tone
- Best Word

## Zip Zap Zop

Basically it gets you to look around and make eye contact with people, and to be aware of your surroundings.

You can apply this to presentations by just looking around the audience, do NOT look at the floor, ceiling, or
scripts constantly (sometimes is okay).

## Breathing

Basically breathe deeply, and use your diaphragm. Don't breathe through just your nose.

It calms yourself down, it's helpful both before and during a presentation. Don't be worried about breathing
during a presentation, just treat it like a break in your speech.

## Projection

Each pair went from saying a word as quietly as possible to as loudly as possible, and then back down again.

My voice cracked at the loud end lol.

The point is to get students comfortable with filling a room with their voice, ie. speaking loudly. And also
doing it in front of others.

## Tongue Twisters

Examples (easiest to hardest):
- A synonym for cinnamon is a cinnamon synonym
- A happy hippo hopped and hiccupped
- No need to light a night-light on a light night like tonight
- He threw three free throws
- Top chopstick shops stock top chopsticks

The purpose of these are to get you to avoid tripping over your words.

## Doinkification

Basically performing a script but all nouns/verbs/adjectives are replaced with the word "doink".

The point is to get you to focus on the rhythm of your speech and your body language, not the content.

## Emulating Confidence

1. Smile (look engaging)
2. Focus on your breath (calm yourself down)
3. Project your voice (sound confident)
4. Loosen your jaw (avoid sounding nervous)
5. Talk slowly (avoid stumbling over words)
6. Realise the (lack of) stakes (it's not a big deal)
