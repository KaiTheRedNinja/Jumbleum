An old guy claims credit for something invented far earlier. Its useful though!

## Overview

- use of Pythagorasâ€™ theorem
- determining whether a triangle is right-angled given the lengths of three sides
- use of trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine and tangent) of acute angles to calculate unknown sides and angles in right-angled triangles
- extending sine and cosine to obtuse angles
- use of the formula 1/2\*a\*b\*sin(C) for the area of a triangle
- use of sine rule and cosine rule for any triangle
- problems in two and three dimensions including those involving angles of elevation and depression and bearings
