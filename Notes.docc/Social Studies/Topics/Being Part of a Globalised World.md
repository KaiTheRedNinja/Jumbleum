## Overview

- What are the factors that contribute to globalisation?
- How can we respond to the economic impacts of globalisation?
- How can we respond to the cultural impacts of globalisation?
- How can we respond to the security impacts of globalisation?

> Definition: Globalisation: The process through which ideas and activities of people living in different parts of the world become 
interconnected.

## Globalisation's Driving Forces
- Driving forces of globalisation
    - Technological advancements
        - Developments in transportation
        - Developments in digital technology
    - Growth of Multinational Corporations

### Technological Advancements

Technological advancements have led to improvements in transportation. This improvement came in the format of speed, capacity, and cost.

- **Speed**: The time taken to travel from one place to another has been reduced significantly. This has allowed people to travel to 
different parts of the world more easily.
    - 1830: Liverpool to Manchester rail travel, 50km, 48km/h
    - 2023: Shinkansen, 500km, 320km/h
- **Capacity**: The number of people and cargo that can be transported has increased. This has allowed more people to travel to different 
parts of the world.
    - 1800: Limited carrying capacity of ships
    - 2023: Large cargo ships can carry up to 600,000 tonnes of containers
- **Cost**: The cost of transportation has decreased. This has made it more affordable for people to travel to different parts of the 
world.
    - 1950: Expensive air travel
    - 2023: Affordable air travel

Additionally, technological advancements have led to developments in digital technology. This has allowed people to communicate with each 
other more easily. Most recently, the internet has allowed people to communicate with each other in real-time. This has allowed people to 
share ideas and information more easily, leading to increased interconnectedness.

### Growth of Multinational Corporations

> Definition: Multinational Corporations (MNCs): Companies that operate in multiple countries.

MNCs drive globalisation due to their global supply chains. These supply chains allow companies to produce goods in and for different 
parts of the world.

- MNCs may choose to operate in different countries due to their unique advantages such as lower costs, access to resources, and access 
to markets.
- MNCs increase the interconnectedness of different countries by creating jobs, transferring knowledge, and promoting economic growth.

## Globalisation from an Economic lens

- Economic impacts of globalisation
    - Economic growth and economic vulnerability experienced by countries
    - Employment opportunities and challenges experienced by individuals
- Responses to economic impacts of globalisation
    - Government support
    - Acquisition of knowledge and skills by individuals

### The Global Economy

Countries participate in the global economy through international trade, where they exchange goods and services with other countries.
- Countries may trade in goods (e.g. cars, electronics) and services (e.g. tourism, education).
- Countries trade because they have different resources and capabilities. For example, Singapore may trade with Malaysia because 
Singapore has a strong financial sector while Malaysia has a strong manufacturing sector.

Other than trade, countries also participate in the global economy through foreign direct investment (FDI). This is where companies 
invest in other countries by setting up factories, offices, or stores. For example, Apple has set up factories in China to produce 
iPhones.

### Globalisation's Economic Impact

Being part of the international economy can mean:
- Opportunities for economic growth
- More vulnerable to external economic shocks
- Employment opportunities for individuals
- Employment challenges, affect income

> Definition: GDP: Gross Domestic Product, the total value of goods and services produced in a country in a year.

As countries participate in the global economy through international trade, their goods and services can reach a larger market. This can 
mean economic growth, because there is a larger demand for their goods and services. For example, Singapore's GDP has grown over the 
years due to its participation in the global economy.

However, being part of the global economy can also mean that countries are more vulnerable to external economic shocks. For example, the 
2008 Global Financial Crisis affected many countries around the world, including Singapore.

### Employment

- Where there is economic growth, more opportunities such as jobs are created
- However, there are also challenges such as job losses due to competition from other countries
- Economic decline can lead to job losses

Globalisation creates jobs
- But the country is open to the global economy businesses can reach a larger market resulting in hired demand. This leads to the 
creation of jobs.
- The presence of MNCs and increased investments encourage the use of more advanced technologies, which create higher level jobs.
- People can also find jobs overseas due to developments in digital and transportation technology.

Globalisation challenges jobs
- MNCs may relocate their operations to countries with lower costs, leading to job losses in the country they move away from.
- Advancements technology can result in the automation of certain jobs
- Local workers may face great competition from foreign labour

### Responses to Economic Impacts of Globalisation

The government may respond
- Through economic cooperation with other countries
- By attracting and making foreign investments
- By providing financial support and developing local expertise
- Pursuing free trade policies
    - Reduces tariffs between agreeing countries to allow lower cost trades

### Acquisition of Knowledge and Skills by Individuals

- Individuals who are digital savvy or possess sought-after skills may be able to get more job opportunities overseas
- However, individuals may find themselves competing with foreign labour. They may also risk losing their jobs when their companies 
relocate.

## Globalisation from a Cultural lens

- Cultural impacts of globalisation
    - Spread of culture
    - Dilution of culture
- Responses to cultural impacts of globalisation
    - Varying degrees of acceptance and rejection

### Ethnic culture

In <doc:Living-in-a-Diverse-Society>, we covered that ethnic culture is understood in terms of customs and traditions of different groups.
- Commonly reflected in language, clothing, art and music
- Encompasses the police, values and practices of the members
- Shared identity and cohesion are created among members

Note that
- A "pure" culture does not exist, due to globalisation and mingling
- Ethnic culture may evolve over time

### Spread of Culture

Globalisation has led to the spread of popular and consumer culture. This is explored in terms of:
- American influence on fast food and media
- The Korean wave

Around the world, many people embrace American culture. This could be because people find aspects of their culture, familiar and 
relatable. As people continue to consume American media, they may also adopt the values and believes represented in their movies.

### Dilution of Culture

Local cultures may come under threat as a result of the spread of other cultures. They can risk being diluted or lose their uniqueness.
- As people become more immersed in global culture, the practice of local cultures may be less widespread
- The dilution of local cultures may eventually lead to some of them being forgotten over time
- Younger generations grew up under the cultural influences of globalisation, and may face difficulties relating to older generations, 
who are more rooted in traditional cultures

### Responses to Cultural Impacts of Globalisation

Countries and individuals have varying degrees of acceptance and rejection of cultural globalisation. This may be due to social political 
or economic reasons.
- Countries like friends have sweeping requirements for French media to protect French culture
- Countries like China have strict policies about imported movies and music to protect their own culture
- Individuals may embrace the spread of foreign products and ideas
- They may also choose to resist the influences of globalisation by supporting local products and practices

## Globalisation from a Security lens
- Security impacts of globalisation and responses of countries and individuals
    - Security impacts of globalisation
        - Transnational terrorism
        - Cyber threats
    - Responses to security impacts of globalisation
        - Vigilance by individuals
        - Security measures by governments within their countries
        - Cooperation among countries

> Definition: Security: The state of being safe, and being free from danger or threat

Remember that one of the <Exploring-Citizenship-and-Governance#Roles-of-government> is to ensure National Security.

Singapore maintains its food, water and energy security through globalisation
- Food: More than 90% of Singapore food is imported
- Water: Singapore imports a large amount of water from Malaysia
- Energy: Singapore imports international energy and fossil fuel

### Terrorism

> Definition: Terrorism: The unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims

Impacts of terrorism:
- Immediate physical impact such as injuries, death and destruction of properties
- Feelings of distrust and fear among people
    - After the Paris terrorist attacks in 2015, people started to discriminate and carry out hate crimes against brown people.

### Cyber Threats

Basically cybercriminals are transnational and because they can be anywhere, its very hard to find them and charge them.

### Responses to Security Impacts of Globalisation

- Security checks
- Biometrics
- Cooperation among countries, such as Interpol
