# Kinematics of Linear Motion

Ch 2: The study of motion in one dimension

## Overview

- Explain the relationships between linear displacement, linear velocity and linear acceleration. (see <doc:Kinematics#Graphs>)
- Sketch the velocity vs time graphs for motions involving constant acceleration or deceleration. (see <doc:Kinematics#Graphs>)
- Solve problems involving constant acceleration or deceleration motion using formulae and velocity 
vs time graphs (see <doc:Kinematics#SUVAT-equations-for-constant-acceleration>)
- Gravitational acceleration is a special case of linear acceleration. (see <doc:Kinematics#Free-fall>)

## Solving problems with SUVAT

See <doc:Kinematics#SUVAT-equations-for-constant-acceleration> for the equations of motion for constant acceleration.

Generally when you are solving for a linear movement question using SUVAT, you should identify which values are known and which you want to determine. Using those, you can choose the correct SUVAT 
equation, as each allows you to ignore one value.

> Warning: The second suvat equation, the one which doesn't include acceleration and looks like the area of trapezium formula, SHOULD NOT BE USED in MEFD. Instead, find a way to form a simultaneous equation so that acceleration cancels out. (Reason: The Almighty Module Leader said so.)

> Important: State the SUVAT equation that you are using before applying them. If your acceleration is 0, you still should state the "a" component of the equation, for completion.

## Non-Uniform Linear Motion

So long as the acceleration is constant for a certain section (ie. the slope of the VT graph is constant), you can use the SUVAT equations within that section.

This generally means you can split up a complex linear motion VT graph into multiple constant linear motion VT graph sections.
