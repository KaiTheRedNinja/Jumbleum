My big brother Indices likes to call me a... Turd?

## Overview
- Laws of Surds
- Conjugate Surds
- Rationalisation (because I ain't very rational at times)

Disclaimer: No imaginary numbers here...

## Laws of Surds
```math
\sqrt{a\times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}
\sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}
\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a} = a
```

## Conjugate Surds & Rationalisation
```math 
(\sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n}) (\sqrt{m}-\sqrt{n}) = (m-n)
```

A fraction involving surds is simplified when its denominator contains no surd. 
Multiply the surd in the denominator by its conjugate surd to rationalise.
