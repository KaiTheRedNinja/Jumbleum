- How do tourist destination regions develop over time
    - Exploration and involvement stages
        - small number of tourists undertaking individual and irregular travel to visit the destination’s primary attractions
        - locals offer tourist services, advertising the destination, requesting for more public tourist amenities and facilities
    - Development and consolidation stages
        - increase in tourist numbers with destinations having more man-made attractions, advertisements and foreign labour
        - growth in tourist numbers slow and tourists outnumber locals resulting in a tourism dependent economy
    - Stagnation and decline or rejuvenation stages
        - tourist numbers peak as a destination’s carrying capacity is reached, resulting in negative impacts
        - tourist numbers decline as a destination loses its tourist appeal or is rejuvenated with new cultural or man-made attractions
- How do different personality characteristics of tourists affect their travel choices
    - Spectrum of personality characteristics
        - Dependables and Venturers, with a small proportion of tourists on both extreme ends
        - majority of tourists in the middle of the spectrum with a mixture of both extremes
    - Features of personality characteristics
        - Dependables spend cautiously, guided by authoritative figures, prefer structure in daily living and the company of friends and family
        - Venturers spend readily, guided by personal judgement, prefer different activities and being alone
    - Personality characteristics influence travel patterns
        - different types of tourist destination regions appeal to tourists with different personality characteristics
        - tourists who are more Venturer types influence travel decisions of those who are more Dependable types
