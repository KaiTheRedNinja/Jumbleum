# Physical Quantities and Units

How physical quantities are measured and represented

## Overview
- S.I. units (see <doc:Physical-Quantities-Units-and-Measurement#SI-Units>)
- Scientific form
- Significant figures
- Prefixes and their magnitudes (see <doc:Physical-Quantities-Units-and-Measurement#Prefixes-and-Magnitude>)
- Conversion of values within metric systems

Note that SI units and prefixes/magnitudes are covered within SST's physics syllabus notes, so 
I'll just link to those instead of duplicating sections.

## Scientific Form

> Definition: Scientific form is a way of expressing numbers that are too large or too small to be conveniently
> expressed in decimal form. It is a standard way of writing numbers using powers of ten.

Scientific form is expressed as:
```math
a \times 10^n
```
where:
- `-10 < `a` < 10`
- `n` is an integer

For example:
- `0.000000123` can be expressed as `1.23 * 10^{-7}`
- `123000000` can be expressed as `1.23 * 10^{8}`
- `123000000` should NOT be expressed as `123 * 10^{6}` (as `a` is not between -10 and 10)

## Significant Figures

- All non-zero digits are significant: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
- Zeros between non-zero digits are significant: 1**0**2, 2**00**5, 5**000**9.
- Leading zeros are never significant: 0.02, 001.887, 0.000515.
- A decimal point indicates all the numbers to the left of it are significant: 5000. is 4 s.f.
- Trailing zeros are significant ONLY if they are a result of rounding off, or if they are after 
the decimal point
    - The exact value of 39000 has 2 s.f.
    - But, 38995 rounded off to 3 s.f. = 39000 (3sf)
    - Similarly, 38995 rounded off to 4 s.f. = 39000 (4sf)
    - But, 1.000 has 4 s.f.
- Exact numbers and integer/mathematical constants have an infinite number of significant
figures. For example, both "12 eggs" and "pi" have an infinite number of s.f.

Combining the conditions of rounding off and level of precision in scientific form:
```math
3.8995 \times 10^4 \textrm{to 4 s.f.} = 3.900 * 10^4
```

You are encouraged to use 4 or 5sf for calculations, but you should round off to 3sf for final answers.

## Conversion of Values within Metric Systems

To convert from one metric unit to another, you can use the following formula:
```math
\textrm{new value} = \textrm{old value} \times \frac{\textrm{new unit}}{\textrm{old unit}}
```
For example,

@Row {
    @Column {
        to convert 5 km to m:
        ```math
        \textrm{new value} = 5 \textrm{ km} \times \frac{1000 \textrm{ m}}{1 \textrm{ km}} = 5000 \textrm{ m}
        ```
    }

    @Column {
        to convert 5 km/hr to m/s:
        ```math
        \textrm{new value} = 5 \textrm{ km/hr} \times \frac{1000 \textrm{ m}}{1 \textrm{ km}} \times \frac{1 \textrm{ hr}}{3600 \textrm{ s}} = 1.3889 \textrm{ m/s}
        ```
    }
}
