# Thevenin's Theorem

DC networks can be reduced to a voltage source and a resistor

## Overview

- To be able to determine the values of Thevenin equivalent resistance `$R_{Th}$` and Thevenin equivalent voltage `$V_{Th}$` for a 
given network

## Thevenin's Theorem

> Definition: Thevenin's Theorem: Any two-terminal, linear bilateral DC network can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source and a series resistor.

Breaking down the conditions:
- **Two-terminal**: The network has two terminals (input and output)
- **Linear**: Ohm's law applies (V = IR)
- **Bilateral**: The network behaves the same in both directions (ie. no diodes or transistors)
- **DC**: The network is powered by a DC source (not AC)

## Steps to Find Thevenin Equivalent

1. **Remove the load**: Remove the part of the circuit between the two terminals, outside the DC network. This should result in an 
open circuit between the two terminals.
2. **Label the terminals**: Label the terminals of the circuit as A and B.
3. **Find the open circuit voltage**: Find the voltage across the terminals A and B. This is the Thevenin equivalent voltage 
`$V_{Th}$`. It is easiest to imagine this as calculating the voltage across the open part of the circuit, since it almost always 
reduces to a voltage divider.
4. **Find the total resistance**: Replace all the voltage sources with a short circuit, the effective resistance between the 
terminals A and B is the Thevenin equivalent resistance `$R_{Th}$`.
