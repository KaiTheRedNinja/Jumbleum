Electronics used to make systems by combining electronic components, which talk using voltage and current.

## Overview
- Simple systems
- Electronic systems
- Electrical signals

## Block Diagrams

> Definition: Block diagram: A diagram that shows the components of a system and how they are connected.

A block diagram consists of three blocks:
1. Input
2. Process
3. Output

For example, a sound activated toy might have:
1. Input: Sound sensor
2. Process: Comparator
3. Output: Speaker

If the process is too complex, is multi-stage or is unknown, just write "Process".

Usually, inputs and outputs are provided via <doc:Input-and-output-transducers>. These convert real-world data
such as moisture levels and converts it to electrical signals that an electronic system can manipulate.

## Different Types of Signal

> Definition: Electrical Signal: A signal that carries information in the form of voltage or current.

Signals can be either analog or digital.

> Definition: Digital Signal: A signal that has only two states, on or off.
> Definition: Analog Signal: A signal that can have any value within a range.

A common example of an analog signal is a sound wave or moisture reading, where there isn't a difinitive "on" or 
"off" state. A common example of an analog signal is a switch, where it is either on or off.

## Common symbols

Symbols you should know and I won't find pictures for:
- Wire
- Resistor
- Fuse
- Battery
- Voltmeter
- Ammeter
- Variable resistor

Symbols that you might not know but i'm too lazy to find pictures for so you only get descriptions:
- Diode: Arrow pointing in the direction of current flow
- LED: Diode with two arrows pointing out
- Photodiode: Diode with two arrows pointing in
- LDR: Resistor with two arrows pointing in
- NPN: Arrow pointing out of the base
- PNP: Arrow pointing into the base
- Capacitor: Two parallel lines
- Polarized Capacitor: Two parallel lines with a + sign, or one parallel line and one curved line with a + sign on the curved line
