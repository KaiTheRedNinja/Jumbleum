Its all about turning data into signals we can use

## Overview

- Basics of input and output transducers
- Thermistor, light-dependent resistor (LDR), infrared diode and microphone
- Loudspeaker, buzzer, motor and electromechanical relay

I honestly don't get why this isn't just a subchapter in <doc:Electronic-Systems>. Its so short.

## Transducers

Input and output transducers are linked to each other in Block Diagrams, which are covered in
<doc:Electronic-Systems>

### Input Transducers

> Definition: Input transducer: A device that converts non-electrical signals into electrical signals

Examples include:
- Thermistors, which convert temperature into electrical signals
- LDRs, which convert light intensity into electrical signals
- Infrared diodes, which convert infrared radiation into electrical signals
- Microphones, which convert sound into electrical signals

Thermistors are resistors that change resistance with temperature. The most common are Negative Temperature
Coefficient, or NTC, thermistors. The resistance of an NTC thermistor decreases as the temperature increases,
roughly but not exactly following `R = k/Î¸`. The graph above shows the relationship between resistance and temperature

One example of using thermistors or similar devices that vary resistance is a voltage divider, covered in <doc:D.C.-Circuits>.
The output voltage can then be processed using <doc:Comparator-timer-and-counter-circuits#Comparator>s and
<doc:Bipolar-Junction-Transistors>.

### Output Transducers

> Definition: Output transducer: A device that converts electrical signals into non-electrical signals

Examples include:
- LEDs, which convert electrical signals into light
- Loudspeakers, which convert electrical signals into sound
- Motors, which convert electrical signals into motion

## Relay

Relays are physical switches that are controlled by electrical signals. They are used to control high-power
devices with low-power signals, like buff transistors.

Relays need a flyback diode D, which is used to protect the transistor from the back EMF generated by the 
relay coil when power is removed.
