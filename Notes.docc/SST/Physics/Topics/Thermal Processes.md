## Transfer of Thermal Energy

The <doc:Kinetic-Particle-Model-of-Matter> states that particles move. This motion gives particles 
kinetic energy. Temperature is a measure of the _average KE posessed by particles_ in a substance.
The more particles move, the higher the temperature.

> Definition: Heat: The flow of thermal energy from a higher temperature region to a lower temperature 
region, until the regions have reached thermal equilibrium and are the same temperature.
> Definition: Thermal Eqilibrium: When two regions are at the same temperature and there is no net 
transfer of heat between them.

- Thermal energy always flows from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature.
- A net flow of thermal energy in the form of heat occurs only when there is a difference in 
temperature.
- Thermal energy is transferred through three different processes (see <doc:#Conduction>, 
<doc:#Convection>, <doc:#Radiation>). Multiple can be happening at once within the same system.
- There is no net heat flow between two regions when they reach the same temperature (i.e. the two 
regions are in thermal equilibrium)

## Conduction

> Definition: Conduction: The transfer of thermal energy through a medium from one particle to
another particle.

Conduction takes place in ALL states of matter, fastest in solids, slowest in gases.

Conduction does **not occur** in a vacuum, as there are no particles to transfer thermal energy.
Things like thermos flasks and double-glazed windows use a vacuum to prevent heat transfer.

Not tested, but heres the formula for conduction, aka Fourier's law
```math
q = k \cdot A \cdot \frac{\Delta T}{d}
```
Where:
- `$q$` is the rate of heat transfer
- `$k$` is the thermal conductivity of the material
- `$A$` is the cross-sectional area of the material
- `ΔT` is the temperature difference between the two ends of the material
- `$d$` is the thickness of the material

### Conduction as Molecular Vibration

MEMORISE THIS:
1. Particles at the heated end of an object **gain KE** and **vibrate more vigorously**.
2. These particles collide with neighbouring particles, transferring KE to them, causing them to
vibrate more vigorously as well.
3. This process continues until particles at the cooler end are also set into vigorous vibration.

### Conduction as Electron Flow
In metals and non-metals, thermal energy can be transferred through molecular vibration. However, in
metals, thermal energy can also be transferred through the flow of free electrons, aka electron 
diffusion. This causes metals to conduct heat better than non-metals.

MEMORISE THIS TOO:
1. In metals, electrons at the heated end **gain KE** and **move more rapidly**
2. They then collide with atoms in cooler parts of the metal, transferring their KE
3. This process continues until particles at the cooler end are also set into vigorous vibration.

## Convection

> Definition: Convection: The transfer of thermal energy by means of convection currents of a fluid
(liquid or gas), due to a difference in density

Convection ONLY takes place in fluids, ie liquids and gasses, not solids, as it requires a medium that
can flow.

This is a sample explanation of convection, the heating of water in a beaker (MEMORISE THIS):
1. When water at the bottom of the beaker is heated, it expands and becomes less dense than the 
surrounding cooler water and rises.
2. The upper region of water is cooler and denser, so it sinks to the bottom of the flask to be heated
3. The process repeats, creating a convection current.

When explaning cooling, use the same logic but invert the directions. Generally, explain:
- The change in density due to cooling/heating
- The rest of the material rising/sinking to replace the cooled/heated material (DO NOT mention the 
cooled/heated materialy moving up/down, its usually not relevant)
- The process repeating

Not tested, but heres the formula for convection, aka Newton's Law of Cooling
```math
q = h \cdot A \cdot \Delta T
```
Where:
- `$q$` is the rate of heat transfer
- `$h$` is the heat transfer coefficient
- `$A$` is the surface area of the object
- `ΔT` is the temperature difference between the object and the surrounding fluid

## Radiation

> Definition: Radiation: The transfer of thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic waves, WITHOUT
the aid of a medium

See <doc:Electromagnetic-Spectrum> for more details on electromagnetic waves.

All bodies with a temperature above absolute zero emit radiation. Radiation does not need a medium to
travel through, which is how the Earth is heated by the sun.

Thermal radiation is almost always infrared radiation, which is slightly beyond red light on the
electromagnetic spectrum. It has a longer wavelength and lower frequency.

### Factors affecting Thermal Radiation
Thermal radiation is affected by the following factors:
- Colour
- Texture

You can remember this as temperature being (courtesy of Mr Szeto):
- Fatphobic (large things with low surface area to volume ratio radiate less)
- Ageist (wrinkly things radiate more than smooth things)
- Racist (black things radiate more than white things)

## Preventing Heat Transfer

Vacuum flasks are a good example of how heat transfer can be prevented, as it prevents all three
methods of heat transfer.

- Conduction: The vacuum prevents the transfer of heat through the walls of the flask. Cork and plastic
as structural materials are poor conductors of heat, reducing heat transfer in areas where a physical 
material is needed.
- Convection: The vacuum prevents the transfer of heat through convection currents
- Radiation: The silvered walls of the flask lower the rate of radiation

Note: Even though silvered surfaces may reflect thermal radiation, DO NOT mention it if its talking 
about the thermos retaining heat from a hot liquid. The silvering is to prevent heat loss through
thermal radiation, NOT to reflect heat back into the liquid.
