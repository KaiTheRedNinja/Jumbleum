}

Candidates write 250â€“350 words on a given situation which will involve viewing a visual text

## Overview

- Speech
- Email

Most of the time, you'll be asked to be formal and persuasive. Keep note of the PACP:
- Purpose
- Audience
- Context
- Persona

Follow the format, but don't worry too much about it. So long as your format isn't too wrong, the markers really do
not care.

## Marks

These are the categories you should aim to hit, each being 10 marks:

- Addressing the required points: All points addressed and developed in detail
- Showing awareness of PACC: PACC fully and clearly addressed.
- Using the given information: Ideas consistently supported by given information.

## Email

Usually, the email would give you a situation, then an associated text. The situation would be something like choosing 
what to do, and the associated text would be a web page, poster, etc. that gives you options related to the situation.

Put a date, address, subject, and salutation. 

Do NOT:
- Copy-paste the instructions of the question. 
- Copy-paste the associated text. 

DO:
- If there are any vague statements in the instructions (eg. "next long school holiday"), clarify them (eg. 
"December holidays"). Same goes for the associated text (eg. web page, poster, etc).
- Give more personal information related to your choice (the question should provide these)
