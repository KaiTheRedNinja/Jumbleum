# Language Use

Language use questions ask how language is used to show stuff

## Overview

The question will be something like "In Paragraph 2, the writer describes the supervisors at the youth detention center. 
Explain how the language used in this paragraph makes them appear superior to the writer."

In this example, you need to cover the following points:
- Supervisors
- Superior to
- Writer

## Format

> Format: "The phrase '...' suggests ... "

No need to actually explain the words. Just state the phrase and what it suggests. Remember to identify the connotations 
behind the points in the question, and make sure that each phrase is connected EVERY one of the points

Somehow according to Ms Afiah's example answers, you can actually use figurative language to explain the language used. 
For example, "The phrase 'nipping at noses and ears' shows that it felt like the wind was biting at these parts of his 
face". "like the wind was biting" is technically a metaphor, so ig we're allowed to use figurative language in our 
answers.

## Tips

- Do not reuse words from ANY of your phrases. If a word you want to use to explain phrase A is a part of phrase B, 
choose an alternative word.
- Do not use the same word to explain different phrases. If you use similar explanations to link back to an overall 
point, change both the words AND the sentence structure.
