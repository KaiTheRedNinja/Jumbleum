# Sustainable Tourism Development

Tourism, sustainably.

## Overview

- How does tourism development help achieve sustainable development?
    - Economic sustainability
        - tourism development should continually provide employment opportunities and income growth
        - tourism development should result in more social services that raise local standards of living
    - Social and environmental sustainability
        - tourism development should respect authenticity of local communities, practices and art forms; and contribute to intercultural understanding and tolerance
        - tourism development should maintain essential ecological processes and conserve natural heritage and protect biodiversity
    - Sustainable tourism development
        - achieved when sustainability principles are applied to the economic, social and environmental aspects of tourism development
        - all three dimensions are balanced to guarantee tourismâ€™s long-term sustainability
- How effective are stakeholders in influencing sustainable tourism development?
    - Governments and international organisations
        - governments establish policies, create plans and enforce regulations to manage tourism development
        - international organisations offer consultancy, financial assistance and raise public awareness
    - Businesses, local communities and tourists
        - businesses and local communities could seek advice from others and participate in decision-making
        - tourists could develop genuine interest in tourist destination regions and interact responsibly
    - Challenges faced by stakeholders
        - stakeholders may have conflicting priorities and needs
        - stakeholders have differing amounts of control over resources and may view how sustainability is measured differently from other stakeholders
- How effective are the different approaches in achieving sustainable tourism development?
    - Ecotourism
        - comprises diverse approaches that lie on a spectrum from hard to soft ecotourism
        - limitations include uncertainty over continuity of efforts in conserving nature and involving local communities
    - Community-based tourism
        - innovative small-scale tourism managed by local communities including homestays and agricultural tourism
        - limitations include the potential loss of local culture and competition from larger-scale tourism operators
    - Pro-poor tourism
        - focused on improving livelihoods of the poor through training and access to micro-finance
        - limitations include the inability to significantly reduce poverty as compared to direct investment in social services
- How might tourism continue to develop sustainably?
    - Sustainable tourism production
        - when demands on ecosystem services do not exceed the supply of resources
        - when different stakeholders adopt a long-term, responsible and coordinated approach instead of short-term profit
    - Sustainable tourism consumption
        - when destination regions manage demand and tourism is consumed responsibly by tourists
        - when policies give local communities primary attention while considering needs of tourists
    - Equitable distribution of tourism benefits
        - effective tourism management to ensure benefits are enjoyed by all
        - minimising negative trade-offs within or between economic, social and environmental dimensions
