# Newton's Third Law

Newton's third law and also free body diagrams

## Overview

- Apply Newtonâ€™s Third Law of Motion
- Identify action-reaction force pairs between objects.
- Draw free body diagrams.
- Replace supports with appropriate reaction forces.

See <doc:Dynamics#Newton's-Third-Law> for some starter information.

> Definition: Newton's Third Law: When two objects interact, every action force exerted by object A
on object B will cause object A to experience a reaction force
from object B that is equal and opposite to the action force that
object A exerted.

## Free Body Diagrams

A free body diagram is drawn for an object of interest, WITHOUT including its supports and shows all forces acting on _the object_.

The requirements are:
1. Shows only ONE object
2. Shows all forces acting on the object

Forces within the object (eg. air pressure within a balloon) are not shown. Forces that the object exerts on other objects are not 
shown (eg. the force of a block on a table).

## Supports

| Type | Reaction Force Count |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| Bars | 1 |
| Tension cables and diagonal rods | 1 |
| Sliding attachments | 1 |
| Hinges | 2 |
| Fixed supports | 3 |
| Pulleys | Number of attached cables |

Generally, if a support can freely move in a given axis, it will not have a reaction force in that axis.

### Bars

Bars directly connect one object to another, with the only reaction force being exerted by the bottom surface onto the bar, vertically 
upwards.

### Tension cables and Diagonal Rods

Bars that exert force sideways (eg. into a wall) or tension cables (eg. on a bridge) have one reaction force, exerted by the wall or other connection point onto the support, at a known angle.

### Sliding Attachments

A collar on a frictionless rod and a frictionless pin in a slot are both sliding attachments. The only reaction force is perpendicular to the rod or slot.

### Hinges

Hinges are like diagonal rods, however they exert a non-vertical force that is at a less obvious angle. A 
bar on a rough surface is similar to a hinge. Examples include bridge supports. The two reaction forces 
are upwards and sideways, exerted by the ground onto the hinge.

### Fixed Supports

Fixed supports are like hinges, but they cannot rotate. Therefore, we have to consider the moment about the fixed support. The three reaction forces are upwards, sideways, and a moment, exerted by the attachment surface onto the support.

### Pulleys

Pulleys are the most complex support, since the number of reaction forces depends on the number of cables. Generally, the number of 
reaction forces is equal to the number of cables supporting the pulley's weight (eg. "downwards" cables won't).
