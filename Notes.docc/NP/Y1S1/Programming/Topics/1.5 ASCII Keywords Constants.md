# ASCII, Keywords, and Constants

These symbols MEAN something!

## Overview

- Explain the concept of ASCII codes
- Explain the concepts of Identifiers and Symbolic constants
- Write simple C program to get inputs of different data types

## ASCII Codes

ASCII is a way to represent characters as integer values. For example, lowercase 'a' is represented by 97, 
uppercase 'A' is represented by 65, and so on.

To represent special characters like newline and tab in string literals, we can use escape sequences.
- `\n` for newline
- `\t` for tab
- `\\` for backslash
- `\'` for single quote
- `\"` for double quote

## Identifiers and Keywords

Identifiers are names given to variables, functions, types, and other entities in a program. They must 
- start with a letter or underscore, but NOT a digit
- can contain letters, digits, and underscores
- cannot be a keyword

Keywords are reserved words in C that have special meaning and cannot be used as identifiers. Examples include:
- `if`
- `else`
- `while`
- `for`
- `return`

Types like `int`, `float`, and `char` are considered keywords as well.

## Symbolic Constants

Symbolic constants are identifiers that represent fixed values. They are defined using the `#define` 
preprocessor directive. The compiler replaces the symbolic constant with its value during preprocessing.

For example:
```c
#define PI 3.14

float area = PI * radius * radius;
// area is now replaced with 3.14 * radius * radius
```
