## Overview
### Learning outcomes:
1. describe the compisition of an atomi in terms of a pisitive nucleus and negatively charged electrons
2. use the terms proton(atomic) number Z, nucleon(mass) number A and isotope
3. use and interpret the term nuclide and use the nuclied notation
4. Show an understanding that nuclear decay is a random and spontaneous process where unstable nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation.
5. show an understanding of the nature of alpha, beta and gamma radiation. Including ionising effect and penetrating particles [β-particles are assumed to be β⁻ particles only]
6. Use equations involving nuclide notation to represent changes in the compisition of the nnucleus when radioactive emissions occur. 
7. Show an understanding of background radiation
8. Use the term half-life in simple calculations [information in tables and decay curves]
9. Discuss the applications and hazards of radioactivity based on:
    - Half-life of radioactive materials
    - Penetrating abilities and Ionising effect of radiation
10. State the meaning of nuclear fusion and fission and relate these nuclear processes to the release of energy from nulcear fuels.

- alpha particles are the least penetrating, but the most ionising. They can be stopped by a piece of paper.

- beta particles are more penetrating than alpha particles, but less ionising. They can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium.

- gamma particles are the most penetrating, but the least ionising. They can be stopped by a thick sheet of lead or concrete.

```math
\alpha \text{ particles are made up of } ^4_2He
```

## Radioactive Decay

> Random Decay: 

> Spontaneous Decay:

Radioactive Decay can come in many forms, the equations below are just examples. They can be applied to any other scenrio too. 

### Alpha Decay
```math
^A_ZX \rightarrow ^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y + ^4_2He
```

### Beta Decay
```math
^A_ZX \rightarrow ^A_{Z+1}Y + \beta^- + \bar{\nu_e}
```

### Gamma Decay
```math
^A_ZX \rightarrow ^A_ZX + \gamma
```

> In general, the equations are usually given, all you have to do is calculate. 
> 
> It'sjust conservation of mass for the Mass numbers, and conservation of charges for the proton numbers. 

## Background Radiation
- natural radiation that is always present in the environment. It comes from:
    - cosmic rays
    - rocks and soil
    - etc. 

- Man-made sources of radiation include:
    - nuclear power stations
    - nuclear weapons testing
    - food and drink
    - medical sources
    - etc.

## Isotope half-life
The time taken for half the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay.
This is a random and spontaneous process.

## Fusion and Fission
