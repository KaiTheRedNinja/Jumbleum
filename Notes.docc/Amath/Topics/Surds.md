My big brother Indices likes to call me a... Turd?

## Overview
- Laws of Surds
- Conjugate Surds
- Rationalisation (because I ain't very rational at times)

Disclaimer: No imaginary numbers here...

## Laws of Surds
```math
\sqrt{a\times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}

\sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}

\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a} = a

a + b\sqrt{c} = d\sqrt{c} \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = d \text{ and } b = c
```

## Conjugate Surds & Rationalisation
```math 
(\sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n}) (\sqrt{m}-\sqrt{n}) = (m-n)
```
Turn irrational to rational üëç

A fraction involving surds is simplified when its denominator contains no surd. 
Multiply the surd in the denominator by its conjugate surd to rationalise. For example,
```math
\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \times \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
```
## Simplifying surds
Surds can be expressed in simplest form by removing the square factors from the radicand. For example,
```math
\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3} = \sqrt{2^2 * 3^2 * 2} = 2*3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
```
