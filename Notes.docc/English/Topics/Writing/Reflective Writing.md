Reflective writing is a personal response to an experience, event, or situation.

## Overview

Reflective writing requires the following components:
- Evidence (the story itself)
- Looking back (also the story itself...?)
- Analysis (how you felt)
- Moving on (what it means for the future)

It makes use of four parts:
1. Recollecting: What the experience was
2. Reliving: How you felt about the experience
3. Reveal: Attitudes/beliefs about the experience 
4. Reshape: How this experience has changed you

## Descriptions

Description:
1. Begin with a description to set the context for the audience (eg. scene)
2. What happened
3. Five Ws (who, what, when, where, why) to engage audience

WHY write vividly?
1. To help the reader imagine the sights, sounds, smells and texture of a scene
2. To focus the reader's attention on a particular aspect of the scene
3. To communicate background information
4. To express a character's thoughts and emotions
5. To set a mood

Think about these questions:
- What influenced this person to make the decisions they did?
- What key incidents led to this event?
- How do I feel about this issue?
- What is the person's character and behaviour like
- How did the event end?
- What arguments might people have about my POV?
- What values does the person hold?
- What positive/negative effect did this event have?
- What steps would I recommend to be taken to improve the situation?

To describe a scene, you can introduce senses and emotions.
1. The first step to vividly describing a place, person, or thing is to imagine it in your mind's eye.
2. Form a "simple impression" of the colors, textures, shapes, feeling, of whatever it is. You may want to use your 5 
senses for this.
3. Search until you have the right words to convey your emotions/ thoughts, i.e. specific/ concrete details.
4. Be concise in your use of vocabulary. Be prepared to delete words that are not immediately relevant to your 
description.

## Analysis

Analysis:
1. The analysis explores the SIGNIFICANCE of the focus of reflective writing.
2. It explores the 'how', 'why' and 'what if'.
3. What is most important / interesting / useful / relevant about the object, event, experience or idea? (TOPIC)
4. How can you explain or justify its importance? (TOPIC)
5. How is it similar to and different from other objects, events, experiences or ideas?

## Writing Style

Narrative Writing

Figurative Language

Sentence Structures
- Passive to describe a setting / problem / character relationships
- Active to describe personal feelings / personal perspective
- Short to express surprise or suspense
- Long to describe a setting or a person or a problem / complication

Examples:
- Forgive and forget. Move on. Those were the mottos that got me through the tormenting recovery phrase.

Dialogue
- only to be used when absolutely certain about punctuation - open and closed inverted commas / new paragraph for new 
speaker
- purposeful - to further character relationships / to express an important plot development.

Examples:
- "Morning, Mrs Lee. Please take a seat, " Mrs Goh extended her invitation to Thomas' mother in an assertive voice that 
was sugared with a tinge of friendliness.

## Structure

1. Imagine a wide-angle lens looking out over your scene. Introduce the place/person.
2. Zoom in on one particular place, aspect of a person, a scene. Describe in vivid detail what you have zoomed in on (5 senses, descriptive language, literary language). End the paragraph with something you can link to the next paragraph.
3. Focus on another aspect of the person/place/object. End the paragraph with something you can link to the next paragraph.
4. Focus on another aspect and use a different technique.
5. Conclusion (you can change back to the wide-angle lens and look over the same scene/aspect mentioned earlier in Para 
1), describe what is different/what has changed/what you have learned
