# Logarithms

The opposite of the exponential function.

## Overview

- invert `$b = a^n$` using logarithms
- simplify expressions involving logarithms (see <doc:Exponential-and-Logarithmic-functions#Basic-Logarithm-Laws>)
- change bases in logarithms (see <doc:Exponential-and-Logarithmic-functions#Basic-Logarithm-Laws>)

## Definition

The logarithm `$log_a b$` is defined as the exponent `$n$` to which the base `$a$` must be raised to obtain 
`$b$`.
```math
b = a^n \implies n = log_a b
```
where `$a$` is the base, `$n$` is the power, and `$b$` is the result of the exponentiation.

## Changing Bases

The change of base formula is:
```math
log_a{b} = \frac{log_x{b}}{log_x{a}}
```
where
- `$x$` is the new base
- `$a$` is the old base
- `$b$` is the result of the exponentiation

To derive this formula, we start with the definition of logarithms:
```math
b = a^n \implies n = log_a b
```
Given another base `$x$`, we can write:
```math
log_x b = log_x a^n
= n \cdot log_x a

log_x b = n \cdot log_x a
```
Rearranging gives us:
```math
n = \frac{log_x b}{log_x a}

log_a b = \frac{log_x b}{log_x a}
```
