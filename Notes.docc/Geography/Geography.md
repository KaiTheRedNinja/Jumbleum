## Overview

- Section A
    - Question 1: Cluster 1 – Geography in Everyday Life (14 marks)
        - 4-6 marks for <doc:Geographical-Methods>
    - Question 2: Cluster 2 – Tourism (18 marks)
- Section B:
    - Question 4: Cluster 4 – Tectonics (18 marks)

Note that Question 3 is on climate. We weren't taught that so I'm going to ignore it.

## Questions

I'm putting these here because its too short to be a separate page.

### Describe Statistics Questions

These questions will usually be "describe" questions, where you have to describe a trend or pattern in the data given.
Use the following structure:
- G: General trend
- A: Anomalies
- S: Specifics (make it notable, such as greatest increase. Don't talk about min or max because its too simple)

Try and include all three.

### Comparison Questions

Remember to use COMPARISON WORDS. For example, if you are asked to compare A and B, you could say:

"A is Ax, Ay. B is Bx, By"

However, even if ALL of the points are valid, this will get you ONE mark because you haven't compared them. You need to 
say something like:

"A is Ax, wheras B is Bx. A is Ay, similarly B is By."

Note that you should split up the points into two paragraphs, because you also need to refer to a figure or table in the 
question.
