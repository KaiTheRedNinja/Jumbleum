When a neutron decides its done with life and decides to become a proton. Or when protons just decide to leave the nucleus. Or energy is emitted randomly for no reason.

## The Composition of the Atom

Atoms contain three types of particles that are of interest to us

| Particle | Charge | Mass |
|:-------- |:------ |:---- |
| Proton   | +1     | 1    |
| Neutron  | 0      | 1    |
| Electron | -1     | Basically 0 |

The **mass number** of an atom is the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. What appears to be the "atomic number" for chemistry
is actually the **charge number** for physics, which is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus. For electrons, its equal to -1 due to its negative charge.

```math
^A_ZX
```

Isotopes are atoms of the same element with the same number of protons but different number of neutrons. 

## Radioactive Decay

> Random Decay: The decay of the Isotope cannot be predicted as to which particular nucleus will decay next.

> Spontaneous Decay: The decay is not affected by environmental changes (e.g temperature and pressure).

Radioactive Decay can come in many forms, the equations below are just examples. They can be applied to any other scenrio too. 

### Alpha Decay
```math
^A_ZX \rightarrow ^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y + ^4_2He
```

### Beta Decay
```math
^A_ZX \rightarrow ^A_{Z+1}Y + ^0_{-1}e
```

### Gamma Decay
```math
^A_ZX \rightarrow ^A_ZX + \gamma
```

In general, the equations are usually given, all you have to do is calculate. It's just conservation of mass for the Mass numbers, and 
conservation of charges for the proton numbers. 

## Radioactive Emissions

|Particles|Composition|Ionising Ability|Penetrating Ability|
|:------    |:---                                                           |:---:        |:---:|
|alpha, α   |2 protons, 2 neutrons                                          |highest    |low|
|beta, β    |electron                                                       |medium     |medium|
|gamma, γ   |electromagnetic radiation, high frequency electromagnetic waves|lowest     |high|

- alpha particles are the least penetrating, but the most ionising. They can be stopped by a piece of paper.

- beta particles are more penetrating than alpha particles, but less ionising. They can be stopped by a thin sheet of aluminium.

- gamma particles are the most penetrating, but the least ionising. They can be stopped by a thick sheet of lead or concrete.

```math
\alpha \text{ particles are made up of } ^4_2He
```

## Background Radiation
- natural radiation that is always present in the environment. It comes from:
    - cosmic rays
    - rocks and soil
    - etc. 

- Man-made sources of radiation include:
    - nuclear power stations
    - nuclear weapons testing
    - food and drink
    - medical sources
    - etc.

## Isotope half-life
The time taken for half the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay. This is a *random* and *spontaneous* process.

The equation that determines the rate of decay is:
```math
N = N_0 e^{-\lambda t}

\textrm{Where}
t = \frac{t_{1/2}}{\ln(2)}

N = N_0 \times (\frac{1}{2})^{\frac{t}{t_{1/2}}}
```

Where:
- `N` is any of the following:
    - The number of radioactive nuclei remaining at time `t`
    - The rate of decay of the radioactive nuclei
- `N_0` is (corresponding with `N`):
    - The initial number of radioactive nuclei
    - The initial rate of decay of the radioactive nuclei
- `λ` is the decay constant
- `t` is the time since N_0 was measured
- `t_{1/2}` is the half-life of the isotope

## Fusion and Fission
> Principal Energy Transfer: 
> During nuclear fission, energy is transferred from the nuclear store of the unstable nucleus to:
> - the kinetic and nuclear stores of the daughter nuclei and neutrons
> - the internal store of the surroundings

> Nuclear Fission: a process in which a parent nucleus splits (usually into two daughter nuclei) and releases a huge amount of energy.

> Nuclear Fusion: a process in which two light atomic nuclei combine to form one heavier atomic nucleus and releases a huge amount of energy.
