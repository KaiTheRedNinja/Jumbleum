Notes. A lot of them. A jumble colosseum of notes. Jumbleum.

## Overview

The Jumbleum is my personal collection of notes, in website form because thats the only way I could motivate myself to write notes.

Each subject has multiple topic. Generally, the **Overview** of each topic will be a summary of the topic, followed by either
- A list of subtopics in **Topics**. The subtopics will be a list of links to the notes for that subtopic.
- Sections for each subtopic. The sections will contain the notes for that subtopic.

## Icon Key

- 🔄: In Progress
- 📝: Theres the minimal amount of something there, and I'm not planning to elaborate on it any time soon
- 📄 or something that looks like it: Not started (docc uses a custom icon that looks like that emoji's outline)
- ✅ or anything else: Completed (I might use different icons for different subjects or topics)

## Disclaimer

> Warning: While I have full confidence that scientific/mathematical information within these notes are factually correct, I cannot
guarantee that all the explanations or exam tips match syllabus requirements.
>
> Certain notes may be incomplete. Please refer to the official syllabus (linked at the top of each subject's page) or school-issued
notes for the most accurate information.

among other modifications.

### Michael de Beyer

Large parts of the Computing subject notes are based on Michael de Beyer's Holy Grail Computing Textbook.

Klifton Cheng has contributed to the Jumbleum in the following ways:
- His contributions to parts of the Computing, Electronics, and Social Studies subject notes in the Jumbleum

### Educational Institutes

The Physics, Electronics, Emath, and Amath content is largely based on notes issued by the School of Science and Technology, Singapore to
its students.

Social Studies content is based on the Social Studies Coursebook for Express/Normal (Academic) stream issued by the Ministry of Education, Singapore.
