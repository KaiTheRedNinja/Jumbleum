The American Standardized Test (SAT) is a test that is used for college admissions in the United States

## Overview

This is NOT intended to be a comprehensive guide to the SATs, this is mainly a collection of questions that I, 
having gone through the Singapore secondary school system, found in the SAT that has not been explicitly covered
in the Singapore system.

> Tip: I got 1530/1600 in the March 2025 SAT, so these notes should generally be reliable.

## Structure

The SAT is divided into 2 main sections, the English comprehension section, followed by the Math section. Each section is
split into two modules, where how the students score in the first module determines the difficulty of the second module.

See [the collegeboard website](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/whats-on-the-test/structure) for more details.

| Module | Questions | Time (minutes) |
|--------|--------|------|
| English 1 | 27 | 32 |
| English 2 | 27 | 32 |
| Math 1 | 22 | 35 |
| Math 2 | 22 | 35 |

## Exam Tips

The SAT is done digitally. There are a LOT of questions and very little time to do them, so:
- **Don't spend too much time on any one question.** If you're stuck, move on and come back to it later. Mark it as "to review"
- **Don't leave any question blank.** There is no penalty for wrong answers, so if you're stuck, guess.
- **Use highlights and annotations.** All sections allow you to highlight, and the English section allows you to annotate text. Use these features to help you remember important details.
- **Identify the important parts of the question.** There WILL be parts of the passage or question which are irrelevant, or innocuous parts that are actually important.
- **Use Desmos.** For most graph or inequality related questions, you can use desmos to find the solution very easily.
- **Have drinks and a snack.** Theres a break in the middle, so bring a drink and a snack to keep you going.
- **Watch the time.** Some people suggest hiding the timer - I say keep it on. Just know that for the reading/writing section, the faster questions are actually at the back.
- **Sleep Early.** Exactly what it says. SATs are early, so sleep early.
