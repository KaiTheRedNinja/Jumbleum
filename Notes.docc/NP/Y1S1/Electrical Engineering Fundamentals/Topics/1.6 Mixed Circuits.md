# Mixed Circuits

When you mix series and parallel circuits

## Overview

- Calculate the effective resistance of series-parallel networks
- Calculate current, PD, and power in series-parallel circuits

## Effective Resistance

Basically just work from the inside-out. If you see a series/parallel circuit, replace it with a resistor
with an equivalent effective resistance, until you end up with a single resistor.

## Current, PD, and Power

You just need to be good at doing multiple current/voltage dividers, and know all the power formulas. As a
refresher, they are:
```math
P = I * V = I^2 * R = \frac{V^2}{R}
```
