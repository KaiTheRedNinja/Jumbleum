My big brother Indices likes to call me a... Turd?

## Overview
- Laws of Surds
- Conjugate Surds
- Rationalisation (because I ain't very rational at times)

Disclaimer: No imaginary numbers here...

## Laws of Surds
```math
\sqrt{a\times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}

\sqrt{\dfrac{a}{b}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{a}}{\sqrt{b}}

\sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{a} = a

a + b\sqrt{c} = d\sqrt{c} \quad \Rightarrow \quad a = d \text{ and } b = c
```

## Conjugate Surds

Conjugate surds are surds of the form
```math
a\sqrt{m} + b\sqrt{n}

\text{or, when } m = 1,

a + b\sqrt{n}
```
where a and b rational, and m and n are positive integers.

You can solve equations with conjugate surds by comparing their coefficients. For example, in
```math
a + b \sqrt{k}
\text{and}
c + d \sqrt{k}
```

if a, b, c, and d are rational, then a = c and b = d.

## Rationalisation

```math 
(\sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n}) (\sqrt{m}-\sqrt{n}) = (m-n)
```

A fully simplified surd fraction is simplified when its denominator is NOT a surd.  Multiply the surd in 
the denominator by its conjugate surd to rationalise. For example,
```math
\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \times \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
```

Sometimes, the denominator may be a conjugate surd instead of just a surd. In such cases, we can make use of
the quadratic property of "difference of squares" to simplify the denominator. For example,
```math
\frac{6}{4\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}}

= \frac{6}{4\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{3}} \times \frac{4\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}}{4\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}}

= \frac{6(4\sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3})}{4^2 \times 2 - 3}

= \frac{24\sqrt{2} + 6\sqrt{3}}{29}
```

## Simplifying surds
Surds can be expressed in simplest form by removing the square factors from the radicand. For example,
```math
\sqrt{72} = \sqrt{2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3} = \sqrt{2^2 * 3^2 * 2} = 2*3\sqrt{2} = 6\sqrt{2}
```
