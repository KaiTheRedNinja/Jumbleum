# Vector Quantities

## Overview
- Vector and scalar quantities (see <doc:Physical-Quantities-Units-and-Measurement#Scalar-vs-Vector>)
    - Use the properties of vector quantities appropriately.
- Basic trigonometric functions for right-angled triangles (see <doc:Dynamics#2D-Force-Resolution>)
- Resolving and combining vectors (see <doc:Dynamics#2D-Force-Resolution>)
    - Resolve a vector into 2 perpendicular components.
    - Combine 2 perpendicular component vectors.
    - Combine vectors to find the resultant vector.

## Resolving and Combining Vectors

See <doc:Dynamics#2D-Force-Resolution> for a starting explanation. To combine vectors, just
- Add the x-components of each vector to get the x-component of the resultant vector.
- Add the y-components of each vector to get the y-component of the resultant vector.
- Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the magnitude of the resultant vector.
- Use the inverse tangent function to find the angle of the resultant vector.

Make sure you apply the sin/cos/tan properly
