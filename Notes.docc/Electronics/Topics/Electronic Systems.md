Electronics used to make systems by combining electronic components, which talk using voltage and current.

## Overview
- Simple systems
- Electronic systems
- Electrical signals

## Block Diagrams

> Definition: Block diagram: A diagram that shows the components of a system and how they are connected.

A block diagram consists of three blocks:
1. Input
2. Process
3. Output

For example, a sound activated toy might have:
1. Input: Sound sensor
2. Process: Comparator
3. Output: Speaker

If the process is too complex, is multi-stage or is unknown, just write "Process".

Usually, inputs and outputs are provided via <doc:Input-and-output-transducers>. These convert real-world data
such as moisture levels and converts it to electrical signals that an electronic system can manipulate.

## Different Types of Signal

> Definition: Electrical Signal: A signal that carries information in the form of voltage or current.

Signals can be either analog or digital.

> Definition: Digital Signal: A signal that has only two states, on or off.
> Definition: Analog Signal: A signal that can have any value within a range.

A common example of an analog signal is a sound wave or moisture reading, where there isn't a difinitive "on" or 
"off" state. A common example of an analog signal is a switch, where it is either on or off.

Theres also transistors and photodiodes which are often tested.
