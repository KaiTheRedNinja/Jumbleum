Notes. A lot of them. A jumble colosseum of notes. Jumbleum.

## Overview

Each subject has multiple topic. Generally, the `Overview` of each topic will be a summary of the topic, followed by either
- A list of subtopics in `Topics`. The subtopics will be a list of links to the notes for that subtopic.
- Sections for each subtopic. The sections will contain the notes for that subtopic.

## Icon Key

- 🔄: In Progress
- 📝: Theres the minimal amount of something there, and I'm not planning to elaborate on it any time soon
- 📄 or something that looks like it: Not started (docc uses a custom icon that looks like that emoji's outline)
- ✅ or anything else: Completed (I might use different icons for different subjects or topics)
