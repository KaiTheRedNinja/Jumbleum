# Resultant Forces

What happens when you combine multiple forces acting on a single body

## Overview

- Determine the appropriate axes to be used during the resolution of forces.
- Apply the appropriate sign conventions to indicate the directions of the force components.
- Present the mathematical and graphical workings for solving problems involving resultant force vectors.

## Deciding the Axes to Use

1. The X and Y axes are perpendicular to each other
2. The X and Y components of the resultant force is non-negative (makes calculations easier)
    > Exception: If two forces are similar in magnitude and opposite in direction, use the cartesian 
    plane where positive Y is 90 degrees anticlockwise from the positive X axis
3. One of the axes is parallel with the ground, *if the ground is sloped*

The goal of choosing the correct axes are to avoid careless mistakes that arise from forgetting 
negative signs or miscalculating angles.

## Sign Conventions

For an axis (eg. x-axis), forces which have a positive component in (ie. go in the same direction as) 
the direction of the axis are positive numbers, and forces which have a negative component in (ie. go 
in the opposite direction to) the direction of the axis are negative.

## Mathematical and Graphical Workings

See <doc:Dynamics#2D-Force-Resolution> for how to resolve forces into their components, and what 
workings to use.
