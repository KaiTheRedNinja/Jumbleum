SAT Mathematics

## Overview

SAT Mathematics questions can either be multiple choice, with 4 options to choose from, or (slightly) open 
ended, where you enter your final answer in a box.

SAT Math tests mainly test the following
- Averages and Statistics
    - What is the average/mean/median/mode/range of the following numbers
    - How does the addition/removal of a number(s) affect the average/mean/median/mode/range
    - Which frequency table correctly represents the data listed
- Probability
    - What is the probability of XXX
    - (context). Based on these results, what is the total number/percentage of XXX that YYY
- Real-world Contexts
    - (context). Which equation best represents the situation
    - (equation). What is the best interpretation of the XXX of the YYY
    - (equation). How much more XXX is AAA than BBB
    - (graph). Which equation defines the graph
    - (table). Which equation best represents the data
    - Sales tax, discounts, and markups
- Geometry
    - Angle/length within a polygon/figure
    - Value of cos/sin/tan of an angle
    - Area/volume of a figure
    - Ratio of lengths/areas/volumes of figures
    - Radius/center of circle given equation
- Equation Solving
    - What is the solution to the equation XXX
    - How many solutions does the equation XXX have
    - What is the X/Y intercept of the graph
    - At how many points do the graphs of the equations intersect
    - If lines are parallel, what is the value of XXX
    - Which expression is equal to XXX
    - Rearrange the equation to express XXX
    - What is the value of XXX in the system of equations (usually has other unknowns)
    - ⭐ The graph is translated up/down/left/right XXX units, (another equatino solving question)
- Quadratics
    - For what value of x does f(x) reach zero/min/max
    - Value of constant in line-parabola intersection
    - ⭐ Transfer between vertex and standard form
    - ⭐ In the given equation, XXX are constants, the (sum/product) of the solutions is YYY (some function of the constants). What is YYY
