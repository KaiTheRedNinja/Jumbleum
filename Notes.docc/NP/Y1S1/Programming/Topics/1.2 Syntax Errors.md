# Syntax Errors

When you don't follow a language's syntax rules and the compiler tells you "i dont know what this means"

## The Syntax Error Pipeline

Syntax is a set of rules you must follow when writing code. For example, in C, all lines must end with 
`;` (exceptions for functions and control flow like if/while/for).

When you break these syntax rules,
1. The compiler will not be able to compile your code
2. The compiler will report an error, usually with a message, the line and column number (the error may 
not actually be at that exact location)

The C compiler compiles code from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. In this example:
```c
int main() {                    // line 0
    printf("Hello, World!")     // line 1
    return 0;                   // line 2
}                               // line 3
```
The compiler scans until the end of line 1, and _doesn't_ find the terminating semicolon. It then 
proceeds to scan line 2, but encounters `return`. Because it expects a terminating semicolon before the 
start of the next statement, it throws an error, citing line 2 as the location of the error. It will say
something like `error: expected ';' before 'return'`.

Importantly, the error is actually caused by the missing semicolon on _line 1_, but the compiler only
detects it after it has scanned _line 2_.
