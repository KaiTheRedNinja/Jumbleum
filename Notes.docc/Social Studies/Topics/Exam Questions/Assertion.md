Assertion is an educated guess on what will happen on the future, based on what the source tells you

## Overview

Question 5, worth 10 marks.

Note that a valid agree + disagree (`AD`)  is worth 5-8 marks (aka, a pass for the question). Two of each gives
you a MINIMUM of 7 marks (still 8 marks total).

A bonus analysis is worth +1 or +2 marks.

> Assertion is prediction, you need to have *Different & Diverse perspectives*
> Assertion has a broader scope

## Format

Format: "'[some statement]'. Using the sources in this case study, explain how far you would agree with the statement"

Its either perspective based, or role based. For example:
- Perspective: "Dyson's move to Singapore is bad for Britain"
    - Identify the perspectives (eg. move good, move bad)
- Role: "Individual responsibility is the best way to manage the spread of fake news"
    - Identify the stakeholders (eg. government, individuals, social media companies)
    - Note that when disagreeing with the role, IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC STAKEHOLDER. For example, "... is not the best way 
    because the government should be responsible"

Write FOUR paragraphs, in an `ABDAD` or `DBADA` format where 
- `A` is agree 
- `D` is disagree.
- `B` is the bonus task

This means that even if you don't have time to finish the last few paragraphs, you can still get a pass for the question.

## Process

1. Analyse the question
2. Categorise sources into agree/disagree. 
    - You are allowed to use a source in both agree and disagree paragraphs, but  make sure that they are in different 
    paragraphs. Do not use a visual source for both agree and disagree paragraphs.
3. Write one paragraph per source
    - Use the BSA format

## Writing Paragraphs

**BSA:**
- Because (reason from source)
- So (immediate impact)
- As a result, (greater outcome at a larger scale)

For example:
- Stand: I agree with the statement as source B supports it.
- Evidence: This is evident from the source where it states 'The only son of a full-time Grab driver and housewife, 
Putra lives in a three-room flat with his ailing grandmother. He receives full financial aid for school."
- Extension: 
    - BECAUSE top schools in Singapore accept students from lower socio economic backgrounds as there is monetary 
    support
    - SO this suggests that no students in Singapore are denied their deserving education pathways due to their 
    financial difficulty.
    - AS A RESULT This recognition of merit instead of SES ensures a level playing field in schools, allowing students 
    from diverse backgrounds to study in the local institution. This indicates that schools in Singapore are 
    socio-economically diverse.

> Note: From "SO" onwards, the information cited MUST NOT be from the source, but rather an inference from the source.

> Important: The last **E** is `Extension`, **NOT** `Explanation` 
> 
> History Students please take note. 

For example, compare the following essays:

@Row {
    @Column {
        Point: I disagree that the integration policy has been effective in creating a bonded society in Singapore as 
        source C shows how people still do not understand the cultures of others. 
        
        Evidence: Source C states "Amy Cheong, who took to social media to complain about her Malay neighbours who were 
        holding a wedding at the void deck, and went on to disparage the Malay society as a whole. Certainly, in this 
        case at least, proximity did not breed understanding". 
        
        Extension: Because people are still complaining about others who have different practices, being near to others 
        does not help with getting to know the practices of others. As a result, the integration policy has failed in 
        getting people to work together and understand each other.
    }

    @Column {
        Point: I disagree that the integration policy has been effective in creating a bonded society in Singapore as 
        source C shows how people still do not understand the cultures of others. 
        
        Evidence: Source C states "Amy Cheong, who took to social media to complain about her Malay neighbours who were 
        holding a wedding at the void deck, and went on to disparage the Malay society as a whole. Certainly, in this 
        case at least, proximity did not breed understanding". 
        
        Extension: Because individuals fundamentally have a lack of understanding and tolerance for cultures different 
        from their own, so the constant close proximity of individuals of diverse backgrounds would only serve to worsen 
        tensions due to misunderstandings brought on by differences in culture. As a result, the community would have 
        heightened tensions due to the frequent unhappiness between neighbours of different cultures, thus preventing 
        the nation as a whole to bond due to such unhappiness.
    }
}

The second one actually uses BSA properly, and goes out of the source. The "because" talks about individuals, "so" goes
on to talk about community, and "as a result" talks about the nation.

> Note: 
> 1. When doing assertion, cover up your evidence, and then make your own extension. This is so that you don't PARAPHRASE but rather give a NEW PERSPECTIVE. 
> 2. Avoid keywords from the evidence in your extension.
> 3. Bring in your own POV* (this one is a bit harder so you can skip it if you don't know how to do it)

## Bonus Task

- Contextual knowledge
- Reliability
- Balanced conclusion (DO NOT ATTEMPT ~ Mr Seah)

The two bonus tasks, CK and R, are worth +1 or +2 marks. They MUST go after an A or DA paragraph. You should try to
attempt it in your second paragraph.

### Contextual Knowledge

Your contextual knowledge must be relevant to the source, and *verifiable* (cannot be a personal anecdote, can be a news 
story).

If your source is a disagree, your contextual knowledge must also disagree. If your source is an agree, your contextual
knowledge must also agree. Your contextual knowledge CANNOT contradict your source.

For example, if the source talks about racial harmony, you can say:
- Point: Additionally from my contextual knowledge, 
- Evidence (knowledge): I know that such values of respect, equality, fairness are promoted in all singapore schools 
during RHD and CCE. 
- Link: Such exposure will further reinforce young Singaporeans' commitment to these values, making RH sustainable.

So long as the example cited in evidence is identifiable (the marker can figure out what you're talking about), 
verifiable, and relevant it is considered valid.

### Reliability

Do CK if you can, don't do this. If you really want to, see <doc:Reliability-Utility-and-Surprise#Higher-Level-Analysis> 
for more details on how to structure this. Note that you are ONLY allowed to do higher-level analysis for the bonus task.

Just prove that the source is reliable/not reliable and leave it as that.
