Manipulating numbers to manipulate... people?

## Overview

> Data Handling:
> Is taking the data, and depending on what is collected, organising it in a way that is understadable and (most of the time) useful. In a nutshell, it's `making the graph`

> Data Analysis:
> Is taking the graph and making sense of the data inside it, it is different from handling raw data. In a nutshell, it's `using the graph`

## Misuse of statistical graphs
- **Misleading scales** - Scales are not uniform, or are not labelled properly
- **Misleading axes** - Axes are not labelled properly, or are not uniform (units)
- **Misleading Size** - Data is not proportional to the size of the graph
- **Missing Data**- Data is missing, or is not shown properly
- **Misleading Title** - Title is not a good representation of the data

## Measures of Central Tendencies
- **Mean** 
    - Average of the data
    - Used when: 
        - data is continuous
        - There are no extreme values
        - The sample size is large
- **Median** 
    - Middle value of the data
    - Used when:
        - Sample size is small
        - There are extreme values
- **Mode** 
    - Most common value of the data
    - Used when:
        - we want to find the common values of a set of data :P

*I trust that you know how to calculate those 3...

## Measures of Spread
- **Range**
    - Difference between the highest and lowest values
- **Interquartile Range**
    - *Interquartile Range = Upper Quartile - Lower Quartile*
    - Difference between the upper and lower quartiles
- **Standard Deviation**
    - Measure of how spread out the values are
    - The larger the standard deviation, the more spread out the values are
    - The smaller the standard deviation, the more the values are clustered around the mean/median
