## Overview

Individual assignment

## Brief

### Task

capture or screenshots)
- Describes the extent to which you believe what you’ve learned can be helpful for your future 
communication needs
    - Elaborate on how you think you’ve improved on your identified communication weakness.

### Requirements

This reflection should have some form of multimedia component to it because, at the bare
minimum, you should *provide photo/video/screenshot documentation of your attendance* for
the training workshops. You are free to express yourself in writing, visuals, audio/video

reflection will be recognised by your tutor when marking this assignment.**
