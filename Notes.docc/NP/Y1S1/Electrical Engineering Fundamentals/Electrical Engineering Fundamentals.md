# Electrical Engineering Fundamentals

Lay the foundation in electrical engineering to prepare us for more specialized modules

## Overview

4 Credit Units

Most of EEFD is covered in SST's <doc:Electronics> subject, so certain chapters may just link to that subject.

> Important: Wear covered shoes, and bring your electronics set (multimeter, battery, breadboard, wires, etc). You may not be allowed in otherwise.

Each week will have 1 hour of OAL, done BEFORE class. Refer to the schedule to see which Brightspace 
assignment/chapter/etc to complete. There will then be 3 hours of class time, which will be a mix of 
theory and practical work.

There are no "definition" questions in EEFD, according to my teacher.

> Note: "Online Tutorial" refers to the digital chapters in Brightspace. "Tutorial" or "Written tutorial" refers to the assignments which you have to fill out on paper - however, the questions are on Brightspace.

## Marks Allotment

| Component | Weight |
| -------- | ------ |
| Common Test | 25% |
| Lab | 5% |
| Written Tutorial | 5% |
| OAL | 5% |
| Quiz | 5$ |
| Lab Test | 15% |
| Exam | 40% |

I think OAL includes online tutorials.

## Equipment

### Multimeter

Measures voltage, current, resistance, continuity (if the circuit is closed), and a few others.

The black lead should always be on the COM port. The red lead should be on the 
- `mA` port when measuring current less than 600mA
- `A` port when measuring current between 600mA and 10A (do NOT measure more than 10A on a multimeter)
- `Vâ„¦` port when measuring anything else

### Power Supply

Remember to
- ONLY use channel 1 (to avoid getting confused)
- Make sure the channel is on
- Turn off the power supply before connecting or disconnecting wires
