# Workshop 1 What's Wrong with Whatsapp

(In-Person) Communicating online

## Overview

- Raise awareness of the different factors affecting online communication on online messaging platforms (eg. Whatsapp)
- Understand how tone is conveyed in text
- Identify your audience, and selecting the right register for them

## Components of a Message

A message has several components (other than the text itself):
- Purpose: Why are you sending this message? (eg. to get something, to rant, etc.)
- Recipiet: Who are you sending this message to? (eg. a friend, a teacher, etc.)
- Tone: How is the mood of the conversation? (eg. is it serious, casual, etc.)
- Register: What is the level of formality of the message? (eg. is it formal, informal, etc.)

Note that online messaging cannot convey body language, facial expressions, or tone of voice. Certain things like
sarcasm may be difficult to convey accurately without TeXtUaL ManIpUlAtIoN or tone indicators like emojis

## Tone Dimensions

Tone can be broken down into four dimensions:

- Formality: How formal is the message? (eg. is it casual, professional, etc.)
- Seriousness: How serious is the message? (eg. is it light-hearted, urgent, etc.)
- Respectfulness: How respectful is the message? (eg. is it polite, irreverent, etc.)
- Padding: How straightforward is the message? (eg. is it straight-to-the-matter, or enthusiastic, etc.)

## Picking Tone for your Audience

Consider your relationship with the recipient. In general, if the recipient has power over you (even if it is just 
for that one conversation, eg. you asking a friend for help), use a more formal tone. If the recipient is a peer or
someone you are close to, you can use a more casual tone. If the recipient is someone you do not know well, or is a
professional contact, use a more neutral tone.

ALWAYS treat your recipient with respect, regardless of your relationship with them. Only send messages that you would
be comfortable with them reading out loud to others, or that you would be comfortable with others reading.

Make sure to understand the recipient's:
- Preferences: eg. some people prefer large blocks of text, while others prefer short messages
- Cultural background: eg. some cultures may have different expectations for formality, or certain words may have
  different connotations in different cultures

Adapt your language to suit the recipient. Also note that in group chats, your message may be read by others, so
consider how your message may be perceived by others in the group.

## Language Choice

- Use *simple* and *straightforward* language for effective communication
- Adapt your language to *match* the recipient's *expectations* and *comfort level*
- Be mindful of *cultural differences* and *sensitivities* in language use
- Do not use language that may be considered offensive or inappropriate, even if it is common in your peer group

## Emojis and Punctuation

Emojis are used in casual conversations, usually to convey tone. Punctuation can also be used to convey tone:
- "Coming!" usually indicates excitement
- "Coming." usually indicates a more serious tone, or that the sender is busy
- "Coming..." usually indicates that the sender is annoyed or frustrated, but this varies by context
- "Coming?" usually indicates that the sender expects a response
- "Coming!?" usually indicates that the sender is annoyed or frustrated, and expects a response
- "Coming" is neutral

## Response Time

Basically,
- Do not pester for a response within 10 minutes
- If you do not get a response within 30 minutes (urgent) or 1 day (not urgent), send a follow-up message

Don't be the ghoster, but also don't bother people.

## Ending a Conversation

The end of a conversation is usually preceded by:
- Longer pauses
- "Even" responses (both parties have said close-ended statements that do not require a response)
- Shorter responses

To avoid misunderstandings, it is best to explicitly state that the conversation is ending, with a closing text like:
- "ok"
- "alright"
- "bye"
- "see you later"
- "thank you for your help"

Of course, make sure you choose a closing text that matches the tone of the conversation.
