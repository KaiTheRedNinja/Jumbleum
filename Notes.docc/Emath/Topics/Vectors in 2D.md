Direction and magnitude, but flat.

## Overview

- use of notations
- representing a vector as a directed line segment
- translation by a vector
- position vectors
- magnitude of a vector
- use of sum and difference of two vectors to express given vectors in terms of two coplanar vectors
- multiplication of a vector by a scalar
- geometric problems involving the use of vectors
