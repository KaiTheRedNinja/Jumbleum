# Conic Sections

Circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas are all conic sections. 

## Overview

Ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas are all defined as the intersection of a plane with a 
double-napped cone. Circles are considered a special case of ellipses, where the foci (plural for 
focus, aka centers) are equal. Rectangular hyperbolas are a special case of degenerate hyperbolas, 
where the focus is at the origin.

## Ellipses

This is the standard form of an ellipse. The major difference from <doc:1.2-Circles> are that ellipses have two radii:
- `a`, the horizontal radius, is the distance from the center to the rightmost point of the ellipse
- `b`, the vertical radius, is the distance from the center to the topmost point of the ellipse

Ellipses are always symmetrical about the x-axis and y-axis, taking its center as the origin. This means that there are no "diagonal" ellipses with this form.

### Standard Form

The standard form of an ellipse is:
```math
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
```
where:
- `a` is the horizontal radius
- `b` is the vertical radius

Note how, if `a` is equal to `b`, the ellipse is a circle with radius `a` (or `b`).
```math
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2} = 1

\frac{x^2 + y^2}{a^2} = 1

x^2 + y^2 = a^2
```

The standard form of an ellipse with its center, `(α, β)` is:
```math
\frac{(x - \alpha)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y - \beta)^2}{b^2} = 1
```

#### Deriving the Standard Form

Consider two points, A and B, with cartesian coordinates `(c, 0)` and `(-c, 0)`, respectively. The 
distance from A to B is `2c`. A curve has a property such that for any point `P` on the curve, the sum 
of the distances from `P` to A and B is a constant `2a`.

@Image(source: "Graph_Ellipse Derivation", alt: "Ellipse Derivation")

To derive the standard form of an ellipse, we first use the distance formula to mathematically express 
the sum-of-distances property:
```math
\overline{PB}^2 = R_1^2 = y^2 + (x + c)^2
\overline{PA}^2 = R_2^2 = y^2 + (x - c)^2
R_1 + R_2 = 2a \quad \textrm{(1)}
```
where we define PB and PA as `R_1` and `R_2`, just to refer to them in a simple way. That is simply the 
pythagoras theorem. We then manipulate the equations to obtain the difference of squares of `R_1` and `R_2`
```math
R_1^2 - R_2^2 = [(x+c)^2 + y^2] - [(x-c)^2 + y^2]
= (x+c)^2 - (x-c)^2
= (x^2 + 2xc + c^2) - (x^2 - 2xc + c^2)
= 4cx \quad \textrm{(2)}
```
Using the difference of squares formula, we can express this as:
```math
R_1^2 - R_2^2 = 4cx = (R_1 + R_2)(R_1 - R_2)
= (2a)(R_1 - R_2)
```
We can hence calculate R_1 - R_2:
```math
R_1 - R_2 = \frac{R_1^2 - R_2^2}{2a} = \frac{4cx}{2a} = \frac{2cx}{a} \quad \textrm{(3)}
```
Then sum the two equations (1) and (3) to obtain a value for `R_1`:
```math
(R_1 + R_2) + (R_1 - R_2) = 2a + \frac{2cx}{a}
2R_1 = 2a + \frac{2cx}{a}
R_1 = a + \frac{cx}{a}
```
We can use the value of R_1 to obtain an equation
```math
R_1 = a + \frac{cx}{a}
\sqrt{y^2 + (x+c)^2} = a + \frac{cx}{a}
\text{Squaring both sides,}
y^2 + (x+c)^2 = (a + \frac{cx}{a})^2
y^2 + x^2 + c^2 + 2cx = a^2 + \frac{c^2x^2}{a^2} + 2cx
y^2 + x^2 + c^2 = a^2 + \frac{c^2x^2}{a^2}
x^2(1-\frac{c^2}{a^2}) + y^2 = a^2 - c^2
```
And finally simplify to obtain the standard form:
```math
x^2(1-\frac{c^2}{a^2}) + y^2 = a^2 - c^2

x^2(\frac{a^2 - c^2}{a^2}) + y^2 = a^2 - c^2

\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{a^2 - c^2} = 1
```
If we define `b` to be equal to `a^2 - c^2`, we can express the standard form as:
```math
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
```
where `a` is the horizontal radius, and `b` is the vertical radius.

### Axes

If `a` is greater than `b`, the ellipse is wider than it is tall, and the x-axis is the major axis. If 
`b` is greater than `a`, the ellipse is taller than it is wide, and the y-axis is the major axis. In 
both cases, the other axis is the minor axis.

| Condition | Major Axis | Minor Axis |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| `a > b`   | x-axis     | y-axis     |
| `b > a`   | y-axis     | x-axis     |
| `a = b`   | neither (circle) | neither (circle) |

Ignore the directrix - we will cover that later.

### Vertices

A circle has *four* vertices, defined as the topmost, bottommost, leftmost, and rightmost points of the ellipse. The vertices are at the following coordinates:
- Topmost: `(0, b)`
- Bottommost: `(0, -b)`
- Leftmost: `(-a, 0)`
- Rightmost: `(a, 0)`

### Foci

Foci are the "centers" of an ellipse. They are defined as:
```math
\text{foci} = \begin{cases} (0, \pm ae) & \text{if } a > b \\ (\pm be, 0) & \text{if } b > a \end{cases}
```
where `e` is the eccentricity of the ellipse (see next section)

Foci have the following properties: 
- The sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant.
- Light rays emitted from one focus will reflect off the ellipse and converge at the other focus.

### Eccentricity

Eccentricity is a measure of how "stretched" an ellipse is. It is defined as:
```math
e^2 = 1 - \begin{cases} \frac{b^2}{a^2} & \text{if } b < a \\ \frac{a^2}{b^2} & \text{if } a < b \end{cases}
```
Basically, its the square root of the ratio of the squares of the radii, where the smaller radius is
the numerator.
