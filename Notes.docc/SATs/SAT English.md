SAT English

## Overview

SAT English questions usually come with a short 1-2 paragraph passage, followed by a question about the passage. 
The questions are always multiple choice, with 4 options to choose from.

SAT English tests mainly test the following:
- Grammar and Punctuation
    - ⭐ Which choice completes the text so that it conforms to the conventions of Standard English
    - Which choice completes the text with the most logical transition
- Vocabulary
    - ⭐ Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?
- Reading Comprehension
    - According to the text, (question about the text's contents)
    - What is the main idea of the text?
    - Which choice best states the main purpose of the text?
    - ⭐ Which choice best supports the author's argument?
    - ⭐ Which choice most logically completes the text?
    - ⭐ Which choice best describes the overall structure of the text?
    - ⭐ Which choice most effectively uses relevant information from the XXX to accomplish this goal
    - ⭐ Which choice most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the example
    - ⭐ Which choice best describes the function of the underlined sentence in the text as a whole?
    - Based on the texts, what would the author of Text 2 most likely say about Text 1?

## Strategy

Some general purpose strategies to answering questions

### Weighing Answers

Don't weigh your answers "pros" against each other ("A fits, but B also fits"). Insted, focus on the "cons" of each answer.
Two answers might both fit, but one might have a small detail that doesn't fit, such as stating something that the text does
not actually say.

### Annotations

As of the time of writing, there are two annotation tools: highlights and notes. Highlights give you three different colours.

Unlike a lot of SAT suggestions, I'd suggest NOT using annotations unless you're stuck on a question (and have come back 
to it after solving the easy ones). Annotations take a lot of time to type, which is better spent on solving other simple
questions.

I'd recommend using highlighters to highlight IMPORTANT parts of a passage or question. Unimportant parts stay 
unhighlighted. Use different colours so that you can differentiate between different types of important parts.

## Grammar

Grammar usually tests these three:
- Plurality (of both nouns and verbs)
- Tense (past, present, future, infinitive/none)
- Punctuation (commas, semicolons, colons, dashes)

### Plurality

For some reason, if the noun is a plural, the verb is a singular. If the noun is singular, the verb is plural.
For example:

- The dog _(singular)_ barks _(singular)_
- The dogs _(plural)_ bark _(plural)_

The SAT will try to hide this, possibly by adding stuff in brackets or making the sentence very long. It is your
job to identify which noun is the subject of the sentence, and pluralise the verb accordingly.

### Punctuation

In general: Dashes are interchangable with commas, semicolons (";") are interchangable with periods, and colons indicate
an example or list.

One thing that the SAT likes to do is test where you'd put a colon with regards to a connecting word. For example:

"Alice knows hundreds of dog breeds. Only three of these dogs are included in her _____ A, B, C, D, and E - of which is grouped with the other dogs despite not being a domesticated dog breed."

Connections should be used whenever two parts of a sentence are not directly related to each other, for example, this sentence.

Usually, you are taught to include the connecting word (eg. "however") with the sentence after the connector. But in this
special case, the "however" has NOTHING to do with the succeeding sentence, so it goes BEFORE the colon ("book, however:")

### Apostrophe

Apostrophes are used to indicate possession. There are three general exceptions to the "'s indicates posession" rule:
- If the subject is a plural that ends with an "s", the apostrophe goes AFTER the "s"
- If the subject is "it", the possessive form is "its" (no apostrophe), and the expansion "it is" has an apostrophe

Other than those two cases, "'s" ALWAYS indicates possession.

## Vocabulary

Fill-the-blank questions are usually the hardest, as they require you to know the meaning of a word in a specific context.

These types of questions usually fall under one of these categories:
- Contrasting with other specific terms. These fit into sentences like "A tends to be X, wheras B tends to be BLANK" or vice versa. The word
you choose for BLANK should contrast with X. Note that contrasting sentences can be VERY sneaky, since the contrasting term (usually "but") might come
at the start of the sentence instead of the middle.
- Complementing with other specific terms. These usually fit into sentences like "A tends to be like X, similarly, B tends to be BLANK" or vice versa.
The word should be similar to X. These types of questions are more advanced than they seem, since it can actually occur within a contrast-looking
question that is involves a double negative, making it a complementing question.
- Describing the next sentence. These fit into sentence pairs, where the first sentene (where the BLANK is) tends to be a statement
and the next sentence tends to be an elaboration. They usually require you to identify the *purpose* of the elaboration. For example, if the elaboration 
sentence talks about accuracy of a method, the BLANK might be "precise"/"accurate"/another synonym.
- Relating to the previous sentence. These are similar to the previous type, except that the BLANK is within the explanation. They usually
require you to identify the *subject matter* of the statement. For example, if the statement talks about a flare, the BLANK might have to do
with its location or brightness.

Theres also a different variant of this question, that goes something like "what does the underlined word mean?". These
can also be treated as fill-the-blank questions, just treat each of the explanation phrases as a candidate word.
