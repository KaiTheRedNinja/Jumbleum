A collection of SS content examples, organised by chapter.

## Overview

I do not know who owns those notes, But all of the examples in this page were initially gathered 
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qMTvYrh5yqgl5pMsgYAp8Wq4KasrUqaEKzfw0ORP6BY/edit).

## Issue 1: Citizenship and Governance

### Chapter 1: What Does Citizenship Mean to Me
@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Legal status**: when a person is recognised by law to be a member of that country

        **Rights**: to the freedom and privileges that citizens in a country have.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: An obligation of male citizens in Singapore is to serve National Service (NS). Under the 
        Enlistment Act introduced in 1967, 18-year-old male citizens and PRs are **required to serve NS**. Following 
        the completion of full-time NS, they will be required to serve up to 40 days of Operationally Ready 
        National Service per year, until 40 or 50 years old.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        When citizens share **common spaces, practices, and experiences**, they develop a **sense of belonging** 
        and emotional attachment to the country.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Singaporeans consider **hawker centres** as important common spaces that represent Singapore's 
        multicultural heritage. In 2019, many Singaporeans, including those living abroad, pledged their 
        support for the country's nomination of its **hawker culture to UNESCO's Representative List** of Intangible 
        Cultural Heritage of Humanity, which was recognised in December 2020.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Shared values**: values that are embraced and seen as important by a group of people.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: During the 2018 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup Russia, 
        Japanese fans were seen using plastic bags to **clear litter at the end of the football match** between 
        Japan and Columbia.

        > Example: In embracing the value of "multiculturalism", Singaporeans generally believe in living in 
        harmony in a multiracial and multireligious society. They make a **conscious effort** to understand and 
        develop **good relationships** with people from different races and religions. As Singaporeans uphold the 
        value of multiculturalism, they take pride and identify this value as an **essential part of being Singaporean**.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 2) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Civic participation**: citizens actively taking part in public affairs to address societal issues or to 
        help certain groups in the country.

        **Public affairs**: matters of general interest or concern to **most people in society**. Individuals can 
        participate by volunteering their time, effort, and money in matters they are concerned about.
    }

    @Column(size: 1) {
        > Example: In 2020, Mr Andy Teo initiated this project, Temporary Academic Assistance, to connect students 
        with volunteer tutors. Mr Teo saw this need when schools moved to full home-based learning during the 
        COVID-19 pandemic. He enlisted the help of tutors through social media to teach for free. In just a week, 
        **250 volunteered to serve**.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 2) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Community groups**: groups of citizens with common interests or purposes that contribute towards specific
        needs of society.

        **Informal groups**: When there is an issue or area of need that requires attention, people organise themselves 
        into **informal community groups** to address the concern or specific need. These groups generally exist for a 
        **period of time** needed to address the specific objectives. They may **not be registered with the government**.
    }

    @Column(size: 1) {
        > Example: Mr Nigel Teo and his friends started a mobile application called GoodHood.SG to **promote 
        neighbourliness in Singapore**. Through the app, individuals in Singapore are able to connect meaningfully with 
        their neighbours by asking for or offering help.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Formal groups**: Formal community groups have clear objectives and are officially registered with the government. 
        They cater to specific needs and interests of society and generally devote their efforts over a **sustained period of time**.

        Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and social service agencies (SSAs) are examples of formal community groups.
        SSAs, unlike NGOs, are **affiliated with the government** through the National Council of Social Service (NCSS), which provides 
        some **coordination and funding**.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Zero Waste Singapore is an NGO leading the drive towards zero waste in Singapore through education 
        and advocacy. It engages the public, companies, schools, and government agencies to discuss the 3Rs in relation 
        to food waste, plastic disposables, household recycling, and organisational waste. In 2017, Zero Waste SG started 
        the Bring Your Own (Singapore) movement, in which 430 retail outlets offered incentives to customers who bring their 
        **own reusable bags, bottles, or containers**. In four months, the initiative reduced over **2.5 million pieces of 
        plastic disposables**.

        > Example: SG Enable is dedicated to enabling persons with disabilities and promoting an inclusive society. Through 
        workshops organised by SG Enable, participants learnt how to **interact with consumers with disabilities** and 
        improve the accessibility of products and services for them.

### Chapter 2: What Are the Functions and Roles of Government in Working for the Good of Society

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Maintain Law and Order**: The government’s role in society is to maintain law and order. The Singapore Police 
        Force (SPF) aims to **prevent, deter, and detect crime**, with its work being wide-ranging. The Courts and law 
        enforcement  agencies that investigate crimes seek to ensure that justice is served in every case. 
        
        Everyone, **including the government itself, is equal before the law**.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: In 2013, a former civil servant from the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau was convicted for misusing 
        money entrusted to his care. He was jailed for 10 years.

        > Example: In 2020, a foreign domestic worker was accused of theft by her employers, the family of a wealthy and 
        prominent business figure. After further investigations following her appeal, she was freed from all criminal charges.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Ensure Economic and Social Well-Being**: One way for governments to ensure citizens' economic and social well-being 
        is by devoting **significant resources** to provide **goods and services to the public**.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Polyclinics located throughout Singapore are one-stop healthcare centres that provide subsidised primary 
        care. Services include outpatient medical treatment and diagnostic tests.

        > Example: The Central Provident Fund (CPF) is a **comprehensive savings plan** that provides a foundation for most 
        **Singaporeans’ retirement**, can be used to buy a home, or pay for healthcare expenses.

        > Example: The **SkillsFuture programme** offers skills-focused courses relevant to **industry needs for career 
        development**, provides SkillsFuture Credit for Singaporeans when they turn 25 years old, Work-Study programmes for 
        students to get a head start in the workforce, and a subsidy of at least 90% for eligible courses for Singaporeans 
        aged 40 and above. For instance, 53-year-old Mdm Zaiton Zaini, a mother of four, initially joined the workforce with 
        an N-Level certificate. Through the SkillsFuture movement, she enrolled in a Professional Diploma in Leadership and 
        People Management in 2018. Encouraged to continuously learn, she obtained a Diploma in Retail and then a Specialist 
        Diploma in Retail in 2021.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **National Interests**: What is necessary to ensure a country’s security and well-being. They influence the objectives 
        of foreign policy. This includes ensuring the country's trade with others can promote economic growth, ensuring the 
        population has sufficient food and water for survival, and ensuring the country is safe from attacks by other countries.

        **Diplomacy**: Practice of obtaining agreement between countries to cooperate in order to produce results that align 
        with their interests.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Singapore maintains strong bilateral relations with Malaysia, an example of which is water security. Under 
        the 1962 Water Agreement, Singapore draws 250 million gallons of raw water per day from the Johor River. In return, 
        Singapore provides Malaysia with a daily supply of treated water, up to 2 percent of the volume supplied to Singapore.

        > Example: Singapore establishes multilateral relationships with other countries through its memberships in regional
        and international organisations like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Through ASEAN, Singapore has 
        been able to establish partnerships with countries within and beyond ASEAN. One such partnership is the Regional 
        Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a trade agreement signed by Singapore and 14 other Asia-Pacific countries. 
        It aims to deepen economic cooperation, facilitate expansion of trade and investment, and increase opportunities for 
        businesses and employment.

        > Example: Businesses in Singapore can take advantage of the strengthened trade ties among RCEP members by enjoying 
        more cost savings and profits due to the elimination of tariffs for about 90 percent of goods traded among the members. 
        Additionally, the RCEP creates a conducive environment for a digital economy, as it is committed to protecting consumers' 
        personal information, promoting paperless trading, electronic authentication systems, and cybersecurity.
    }

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Deterrence**: Measures a country takes to discourage potential aggressors by making it costly for them to attack.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: The Ministry of Defence develops the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) to respond to military threats. Developed 
        and manufactured locally, the Hunter Armoured Fighting Vehicle (AFV) is the Singapore Army's first fully digitalised 
        platform. It requires less manpower to operate, has touchscreen controls, and an automatic system that enables the crew 
        to detect and engage targets quickly and effectively. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are crucial for effective aerial 
        surveillance and coordinated strikes. The Orbiter 4 CR-UAV can be deployed quickly and in confined areas to scan the
        battlefield so commanders can understand the situation and make better decisions. The SAF's command and control information 
        system uses AI and data analytics to quickly recognise enemy appearances, calculate the time needed for enemies to reach 
        a strike location, and recommend strike locations and weapons to use against threats. This allows commanders to coordinate 
        attacks with greater speed, ease, and precision.

### Chapter 3: How Do We Decide What Is Good for Society

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Unequal Sharing of Costs**: Varying impact a decision has on different groups of people.

        **Trade-off**: Involves making a decision between two or more things that cannot be obtained at the same time due to 
        limited resources.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: In January 2013, the Singapore government announced plans to build the Cross Island Line (CRL) as Singapore's 
        eighth Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) line. The CRL was proposed to pass through and run under the Central Catchment Nature 
        Reserve. When completed, it will be the longest fully underground line and will link major hubs such as the Jurong Lake 
        District and the Punggol Digital District. The CRL is projected to serve 600,000 commuters per day, increasing to over 
        1 million in the longer term. The CRL will have the highest number of interchange stations, with almost half the stations 
        on the line linked to existing rail stations. While Singaporeans could agree on some of the benefits the CRL brings to 
        society, there were disagreements on which route it should take. In July 2013, the Nature Society (Singapore) (NSS) 
        raised concerns about the construction of the CRL and recommended adjusting the route to skirt around the nature reserve. 
        Before making the final decision on the CRL route in 2019, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) had to consider the two 
        options carefully.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Governance**: Defined as the exercise of authority and the use of resources to manage the problems and affairs of 
        society.

        **Meritocracy**: A system that distributes opportunities and rewards according to merit. People are rewarded according 
        to the effort they put in rather than factors like race, religion, and family background.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: The Edusave Award for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES) is given to up to 10 percent of 
        students from each school who have demonstrated leadership qualities, service to the community and schools, excellence 
        in non-academic activities, and good conduct.

        > Example: The Edusave Good Progress Award is given to students who are within the top 10 percent of their school's level 
        and course in terms of improvement in academic performance and have demonstrated good conduct.

        > Example: The Edusave Scholarship is awarded to students who are within the top 10 percent of their school's level and 
        course in terms of academic performance and have demonstrated good conduct.

        > Example: Singapore's effort to tackle the challenge of rising sea levels includes setting aside a $5 billion budget in 
        2020 for the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund to help the country meet the significant risks of rising sea levels caused 
        by climate change. This effort was highlighted by PM Lee Hsien Loong during the National Day Rally in 2019.

        > Example: The Singapore Together movement, launched in June 2019, encourages Singaporeans to partner with the 
        government and each other to shape and act on their shared future. This includes partnership opportunities or government 
        support for citizen-led initiatives. The Emerging Stronger Conversations (ESC) series, part of this movement, ran from 
        June to September 2020 and involved over 16,900 Singaporeans expressing their hopes for how Singapore can emerge stronger 
        from the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Chapter 4: How Can We Work Together for the Good of Society?

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Efforts by Community Groups**
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: RSVP Singapore is an example of a social service agency (SSA), a formal community group organised by 
        citizens. Formed in 1998, RSVP Singapore actively engages senior citizens in volunteerism. This group believes that 
        seniors play a vital role in society and seeks to provide them with meaningful opportunities to contribute to the 
        community. Senior volunteers at RSVP Singapore serve more than 200,000 beneficiaries each year. Beneficiaries include 
        socially isolated seniors, elderly patients discharged from hospital care, the mentally disadvantaged, and at-risk 
        children from low-income families. RSVP Singapore also runs the Volunteer Learning Centre, where qualified senior 
        volunteers train other volunteers. Volunteers in the MyBuddy programme at RSVP Singapore help recently discharged 
        elderly patients cope well at home by offering physical and moral support during regular house visits. The Cyberguide 
        programme at RSVP Singapore offers a wide range of courses that equip senior citizens with up-to-date IT skills and 
        knowledge.

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Efforts by the Government**
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Government agencies such as the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) develop resources to enhance the 
        capabilities of SSAs, including those committed to meeting the needs of the elderly. NCSS developed the Volunteer 
        Management Toolkit 2.0 to provide SSAs with a framework and guidelines on how to manage volunteers effectively. It 
        worked with various partners such as RSVP Singapore to contribute to the development of the Toolkit by sharing their 
        best practices in Volunteer Management, so that the learning can be shared with the rest of the SSAs.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Addressing Gaps in Needs**: Despite the efforts of community groups and the government, there could still be gaps in 
        addressing specific needs of groups of people. To bridge these gaps, individuals can initiate their own efforts or 
        actively tap on the resources and programmes provided by the government and community groups. Complementary efforts are 
        important as the needs and challenges of certain groups in society are complex and some would benefit from more 
        personalised attention and care.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Reaching Everyone for Active Citizenry @ Home (REACH) is the national feedback and engagement unit under 
        the Ministry of Communications and Information. It seeks to engage citizens' views on public policies, listen to their 
        concerns and issues, and consolidate and share the feedback with relevant government agencies. REACH uses social media 
        platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Facebook, in addition to email and online feedback, to encourage 
        Singaporeans to highlight key issues of concern to the government. It also organises both face-to-face and online 
        engagement sessions such as public forums, dialogue sessions, and Listening Points (roving feedback booths) to involve 
        Singaporeans in shaping public policies.

        > Example: The Citizens' Jury for the War on Diabetes is an example of citizens and the government working together to 
        influence public policy decision-making. In 2016, the Ministry of Health (MOH) launched a nationwide effort, the War on 
        Diabetes, to help Singaporeans prevent and manage diabetes. As part of this effort, MOH organised Singapore's first 
        Citizens' Jury to develop community-based and community-driven recommendations. The jury included 76 Citizen Jurors 
        (Singapore citizens and PRs), such as people living with and without diabetes, caregivers, and healthcare providers. 
        Resources provided by MOH included an information kit with data on diabetes and contributions from 21 experts (healthcare 
        practitioners, academics, and volunteers) from various organisations. The process involved 4 sessions over 7 weeks from 
        November 2017 to January 2018. On April 14, 2018, MOH announced that it would support 14 out of 28 recommendations and 
        explore the remaining 13. Supported recommendations included installing more water coolers in public areas as part of a 
        campaign to drink more water and implementing a diabetes awareness campaign and curriculum for children.

    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Ways Citizens Can Develop a Sense of Belonging**
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Every year, Singaporeans celebrate National Day on 9 August, commemorating the day Singapore gained 
        independence.

        > Example: Through programmes such as Remaking Our Heartland and HDB's Build-A-Playground, citizens can participate in 
        surveys, focus group discussions, and workshops to contribute ideas for the design of neighbourhood spaces such as parks 
        and playgrounds.

There are a few more examples about Dakota Crescent's redevelopment. I'm not including them because they're very long.

## Issue 2: Living in a Diverse Society

### Chapter 5: What are the factors that shape the identities of people and contribute to a diverse society?

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Socio-Cultural Diversity**: Different races, ethnicities, religions, and nationalities.

        **Socio-Economic Diversity**: Different socio-economic backgrounds due to education, income, and wealth.

        **Race**: Biological classification of people including physical characteristics.

        **Ethnicity**: Culture of a group of people who share ancestry, customs, and traditions.

        **CMIO**: Chinese, Malay, Indian, Others, racial categorisation in Singapore.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: The Group Representation Constituency (GRC) was established in 1988 to ensure that minority races in 
        Singapore are represented in Parliament. A group of Members of Parliament (MPs) represents the interests of residents 
        in the constituency. At least one of the MPs in the group representing a GRC must belong to the Malay or Indian community, 
        or another minority racial community.

        > Example: The Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) was introduced in 1989 to promote interaction and harmony among ethnic 
        groups in Singapore. Its aim was also to prevent the rise of ethnic enclaves. The EIP ensures that there is a mix of 
        various ethnic groups in each HDB block, based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore. Since different ethnic groups live 
        in the same block, they have opportunities to interact with one another.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Socio-Economic Status**: Economic situation shared by a group of people.

        **Social Mobility**: An individual’s movement across socio-economic positions.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: To ensure children have a good start in life, the Singapore government introduced the KidSTART programme as 
        added support for children ged six and below. KidSTART equips parents with relevant knowledge and skills to nurture their 
        child's early development. KidSTART is offered to families that need it most, such as those with a household income of 
        $2,500 or less, or a gross monthly per capita income of $650 or less.

}

### Chapter 6: What Are the Experiences and Effects of Living in a Diverse Society?

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Common Space**: Physical location and/or a social space where different groups of people interact, cooperate, or 
        collaborate on projects/activities.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: A void deck in Ang Mo Kio serves as a common space for bird enthusiasts to gather and enjoy the singing of 
        songbirds.

        > Example: The Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCCs) were first established in 2002 to serve as an 
        inter-faith platform. IRCCs are formed in every constituency to promote racial and religious harmony among different 
        religious, ethnic, and community groups. On 30 July 2022, the IRCCs were renamed as Racial and Religious Harmony Circles. 
        They continue to deepen the work of building trust, understanding, and confidence among various communities through 
        activities that promote inter-faith and inter-ethnic interactions.

        > Example: The People’s Association (PA) aims to promote racial harmony and social cohesion in Singapore. It offers a 
        wide range of community service, sports, and cultural programmes that help connect people to people and people with 
        the government. These programmes are carried out through a network of over 2,000 grassroots organisations, over 100 
        Community Clubs/Centres (CCs), five Community Development Councils, the National Community Leadership Institute, and 
        PAssion WaVe.

        > Example: Just An Extra Chair is an initiative organised by the Singapore Kindness Movement. Singaporeans who are 
        willing host guests during festive celebrations. Most of the guests are foreigners working or studying in Singapore who 
        would otherwise spend festive seasons alone.

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Dilution of Culture**: Loss of identity in affected communities.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: The month-long Geylang Serai Hari Raya bazaar, held during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, has 
        incorporated fusion food since 2019. This has led to a strong public reaction, with many saying that the bazaar has 
        deviated too much from tradition. As a response to this outcry, it was recommended that at least 60 per cent of the 
        bazaar's food stalls should sell traditional Malay food.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Cultural Appropriation**: When a language, cuisine, music, dance, or dress of a culture is used without permission 
        or portrayed in an insensitive manner.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: In 2019, a large Italian fashion company plagiarised the traditional designs of the Oma ethnic minority 
        group in their clothing collection. The company digitally duplicated and printed the designs onto their dresses, 
        skirts, and blouses. The colours, shapes, and arrangement of the designs were identical to the traditional Oma 
        designs. The company was called out for cultural appropriation. People pointed out that simply scanning and printing 
        the traditional designs on clothing was disrespectful to the Oma people, who take the time, skill, and patience to 
        create their homemade textiles. Furthermore, the company did not acknowledge the Oma in their marketing, labelling, 
        or display of the clothing collection, nor did they provide any compensation to the Oma.

        > Example: Thermo Fisher Scientific is one of the world's largest medical device makers. For over two decades, 
        Thermo Fisher's research and development (R&D) centre has been in Singapore because of its well-developed infrastructure 
        for biomedical research and development. Singaporeans in the company are trained in leadership skills and encouraged 
        to collaborate with employees from different cultures, experiences, and expertise, enabling employees to sharpen their 
        skills by sharing and learning from one another.

        > Example: In June 2021, an interracial couple comprising a man of Indian and Filipino-Spanish descent and his 
        girlfriend of Thai-Chinese descent were strolling along Orchard Road. A local Chinese man confronted the couple and 
        accused the man of "preying on a Chinese girl" and ordered him to date "people of his own race". The Chinese man was 
        later fired from his job as a polytechnic lecturer and was charged in court for his actions.

        > Example: A nurse had been on good terms with his neighbours for six years. However, that changed in 2021 during the 
        COVID-19 pandemic when his neighbours learned that the nurse and his wife were frontline workers. His neighbours 
        repeatedly harassed them, called them a "virus" before proceeding to spray their daughter's face with disinfectant, and 
        poured disinfectant at their doorway. His parents were also verbally abused. The neighbours were later charged and 
        pleaded guilty to their actions.

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {

        **Assimilationist Policies**: Immigrants are expected to adopt the beliefs and practices of the majority group in the 
        host country. Over time, the identities of the assimilated group are expected to become identical to those of the 
        majority group. (e.g., Denmark, Germany, and France)
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: France believes that the ideal of harmony in society is achieved when every individual puts aside his or 
        her connections to race, ethnicity, and religion. While France acknowledges the existence of diverse cultural identities, 
        it believes that the French national identity should be prioritized over other identities.
    }

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        **Secularism**: Belief in setting a clear separation of religious affairs from governance and not favouring one 
        religion over another.
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: In the French classroom, there is no discussion about religion except in History, Literature, Philosophy, 
        and Art classes. In 2015, France launched a new course in moral and civic education to promote the values of its national 
        motto, as well as justice, mutual respect, and non-discrimination.
        > Example: The French government introduced the Diversity Charter in 2004 to raise employers' awareness of recruiting 
        employees from diverse backgrounds. The charter encourages companies to be inclusive and carry out tangible actions to 
        promote diversity at the workplace.

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: In France, immigrants seeking citizenship can attend a four-day civic training course in French principles 
        and values, as well as practical aspects of life in French society. Up to 600 hours of free language courses are also 
        offered to help immigrants master French in their everyday life.
        > Example: In 2004, France introduced a law that banned the wearing of clearly visible religious attire and symbols in 
        public schools. This was to maintain religious neutrality in French public schools.

    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: In 2009, the National Integration Council launched the Community Integration Fund to support organisations 
        in implementing projects to encourage interactions between Singaporeans, immigrants, and foreigners so that they can 
        deepen mutual understanding, build relationships with each other, and develop a stronger connection to Singapore.
        > Example: The People's Association organises events like house visits, block parties, and festive celebrations so that 
        new Singapore citizens and Permanent Residents can get to know their neighbourhood better and make new friends in the 
        community.
        > Example: New Singapore citizens go through a compulsory programme called the Singapore Citizenship Journey, a 
        collaborative effort between the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, the Immigration & Checkpoints Authority, and 
        the People's Association.

        > Example: In serving to defend Singapore, National Service (NS) brings people from diverse backgrounds to train and live 
        together. Through this common experience, NSmen learn to develop a sense of collective interest. This common life-shaping 
        experience helps to strengthen the relationships between them and create a strong Singapore national identity.
        > Example: The Armed Forces Volunteer Corps (SAFVC) provides an opportunity for individuals who are not required to serve 
        NS, such as women, first-generation Singapore PRs, and new citizens aged 18 to 45, to contribute to Singapore's national 
        defence.

        > Example: In 2014, Mr Nizar Mohamed Shariff started a charity called Free Food For All (FFFA) to provide nutritious 
        halal food to the less fortunate, regardless of their race or religion. Initially focused on delivering freshly cooked 
        meals, FFFA now offers different food options and channels, which include ready-to-eat (RTE) meals, fresh vegetables, 
        groceries, and a weekly stocked community fridge. They also collaborate with other food businesses to cater RTE meals 
        for their beneficiaries. In 2021 alone, FFFA served more than 160,000 meals, including RTE meals to more than 1,000 
        families each month.

        > Example: Daughters Of Tomorrow (DOT) is a formal community group that conducts programmes to help women aged 20 to 60 
        upgrade their skills and find jobs. Most of these women come from low-income families or live in subsidised rental flats. 
        DOT's financial literacy programme is a series of four weekly workshops followedby seven months with a support group. 
        The women learn good money-management skills and progress towards their financial goals.

        > Example: Keeping Hope Alive (KHA) is an informal group whose volunteers offer their time and skills to help the less 
        privileged in Singapore. Every Sunday, about 50 to 60 volunteers conduct door-to-door visits to one- and two-room rental 
        flats to look out for residents who are in need and take action to meet their needs. These actions include cleaning 
        their homes, fixing and replacing their home appliances, and providing them with haircuts.

        covers a distance of around 3,478 km and its trains can travel up to 320 km/h.

        > Example: The Singapore-Johor Causeway and the Tuas Second Link connect Singapore and Malaysia by land. It facilitates 
        the commute of workers daily between Malaysia and Singapore, and also supports the import of water between the two 
        countries.

        > Example: Singapore is a key transit node on many flight routes that connect the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australasia. 
        Singapore has an advantage as it is located within a seven-hour flight radius of major markets in East Asia and 
        Southeast Asia.

        > Example: The Port of Singapore is situated at the crossroads of some of the world’s busiest commercial shipping lanes 
        that connect Asia, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas. Annually, over 130,000 vessels call at the Port of Singapore, 
        which serves about 200 shipping lines linking more than 600 ports in over 120 countries.
