## Fake News and How to Spot It

Fake news is false information that is presented as if it were true.

### How Fake News (traditionally) Spreads

Previously, information could only be spread through newspapers, TV, and radio - these limited sources of 
information restricted the spread of fake news, as the "network" effect was nonexistent.

Back then, fake news usually only spread via circular reporting. Basically:
1. Source A reports a false story
2. Source B reports on Source A's story, citing it as a source
3. Source A then cites Source B as a source

Or,
1. Source A, B, and C all report on a false story
2. Source D reports on A, B, and C's stories, citing them as multiple corroborating sources

This is attributed to the rise of vaccine skepticism, due to the spread of a false paper that claimed a link 
between vaccines and autism.

There are also times where satire is re-reported as fact.

### How Fake News Spreads Now

The rise of the internet resulted in the rise of user generated content, which has no editorial oversight.

Most people are *NOT* able to spot fake news, even if they believe they can. This is because most fake
news provokes anger, and is also simple to understand. These two turn off the reasoning part of the brain,
making it easier to believe.

### Mis vs Disinformation

- **Misinformation** is false information that is spread without the intent to deceive.
- **Disinformation** is false information that is spread _with_ the intent to deceive.

### How to Spot Fake News

1. Is the source from a well-known outlet?
2. Is the source trying to make me angry?
3. Where is the information in the source coming from?
4. Does the source stand to benefit from me believing the information presented?

## Echo Chambers and Confirmation Bias

Echo chambers are is somewhat related to fake news, and is linked to confirmation bias. Basically, it 
is the idea that you only follow people who share your views, and so you only see content that agrees 
with you - regardless of it's factuality.

People's brains are wired to *not change* views once they are formed, and thus information that contradicts
them is ignored and information that supports them is amplified.

We don't use the part of the brain responsible for reasoning when we're processing information, rather
we use the emotional part. This is because we are social, and it is more "worth it" to be socially accepted 
than to risk rejection by changing our views.

Steps to avoid echo chambers:
1. Recognise that you have at least some confirmation bias
2. Consider that you may not understand everything (if you can't explain it, you don't understand it)
3. Research and break down the opposing viewpoint

## Digital Footprint

Basically you can get in trouble for something you said online, even if you said it a long time ago or
said it in a private/anonymous message.

Everything you post online is permanent because it can be copied by anything with access. As such, every
online interaction you have adds to your digital footprint.

Employers or the public (if you're famous) may look at your digital footprint, and it may affect
your employability or public image.

### Cleaning Up Your Digital Footprint

1. Be aware of your digital footprint
    - Review old social media accounts and posts to manage your digital footprint.
    - Make a list of all past social media accounts and delete those you no longer use, rather than just deactivating them.
2. Remove potentially embarrassing content that could harm your career or personal life.
    - Something being available in an internet archive is better than it being available publicly
3. Be discerning about what and where you post online.
    - Regularly evaluate your current social media posts and pictures to ensure they reflect your best self.
    - Be mindful of what you share online, as employers may review your social media presence.
    - Adjust privacy settings on social media to limit who can see your posts, ideally restricting access to friends only.
    - Reassess your friend list to ensure that only trusted individuals have access to your online life.
    - Consider the potential risks of sharing content, as even private posts can be leaked by friends.

## POFMA

POFMA stands for the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act, and it is a law in Singapore that
aims to combat the spread of false information online.

It allows the government to:
1. Issue corrections to,
2. Take down,
3. Block accounts which spread false information.

This generally only applies in two cases:
1. The false information has a wide reach (eg. goes viral or is spread by an influencer)
2. The false information is likely to cause harm (eg. inciting violence, causing panic, etc.)

It does NOT apply to:
1. Opinions, satire, or parody
2. Criticism of the government or public officials (NOTE: you can still be sued for defamation, just not under POFMA.)
