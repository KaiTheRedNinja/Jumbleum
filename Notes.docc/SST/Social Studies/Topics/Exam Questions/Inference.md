The mother of all skills, you're as good as dead without it

## Overview
Key learning:
- Comprehend and extract relevant information
- draw inferences from givene information

Kinds of questions that use inference: 
- Inference 
- Reliability
- Utility

see <doc:Reliability-Utility-and-Surprise>

> Important: Main message has to answer both the Question and the Big Question to get a valid inference, else it may be a valid 
subpoint (not holistic) or an invalid point (completely wrong). If the BOC is wrong, everything else does not matter, even it the 
evidence and explanation are valid. 

## Possible sources

### Pictorial Source

**The use of symbols to represent something**, this is why we have inference questions in SS papers.

SS papers tend to use *Photos/Cartoons/Comics/Statistics*, specifically **political cartoons**

Usually, the message of a source relates to the big question. When you come up with your message, try and link it so that it
answers the big question.

#### Use the EPIC framework to Decompose the image
1. Events (context)
2. People
3. Items
4. Captions 
 
#### Cartooning Techniques
- Symbolism → use of symbols to represent something, ie. hints in the provenance telling you what unlabelled items in the image are. 
- Contrast → in size, colour, numbers, etc
- Exaggeration, Mockery, Sarcasm, Irony, [literary devices/language use] → to make a point

### Text Based Source

SS papers tend to use *Articles/Reports/Statements/Speeches*, specifically **speeches**. Theres very little unique about text based 
sources.

## Message

#### Format
1. **Point:** "The message of the source is that `[Topic from Big Question]` is `[adjective]`, as
`[parties involved/relationship].`"
    - Note that if the source is negative with regards to the big question, use NEGATIVE adjectives and relationships between the 
    parties. Do not compare them in isolation; compare the parties to each other directly.
    - The topic from the big question doesn't need to be the big question verbatim. It just needs to target at least ONE of the 
    stakeholders or focuses in the big question (eg. in "How meritocratic is the SG education system today?", you can target just
    meritocracy without ties to the SG education system)
2. **Evidence:** "The source states `[evidence from source]`"
3. **Explanation:** "This shows that `[explanation, this has to support the evidence]`"
4. **Link:** `[why this is important to the message]`

> One way to check if your point is correct is to see if you **need** multiple parts of the source as support. If you do, your message is likely correct.

We use PEEL so that we _force_ ourselves to choose evidence to support our point, which reduces the meandering that can happen when 
we don't have a clear point.

## Purpose

Author's purpose is to:
- Convey a message → main inference
- Achieve an outcome → impact on audience
- Address the context → response to the information that cause the author to have this purpose

### Format
To get L3/4*:
- Point
    - 5A's → Author, "Aim", Action word, Audience, Anticipated outcome
    - To get L4/5-6:
        - Anticipated outcome: Change in mindset
        - Anticipated outcome: Change in behaviour
        - Anticipated outcome: Something related to context that the change in behaviour would result in. Usually, 
        this is linked back to the big question.
- Evidence 
- Explanation
- Link to context
