a relation or expression involving one or more variables, and also how it looks when drawn out

## Overview

- Cartesian coordinates in two dimensions
- graph of a set of ordered pairs as a representation of a relationship between two variables
- linear functions (y = ax + b) and quadratic functions (y = ax2 + bx + c)
- graphs of linear functions
- the gradient of a linear graph as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change (positive and negative gradients)
- graphs of quadratic functions and their properties:
    - positive or negative coefficient of x2
    - maximum and minimum points
    - symmetry
- sketching the graphs of quadratic functions given in the form:
    - y = – (x − p) 2 + q
    - y = − (x − p) 2 + q
    - y = – (x − a)(x − b)
    - y = − (x − a)(x − b)
- graphs of power functions of the form y = ax n, where n = −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and simple sums of not more than three of these
- graphs of exponential functions y = ka x, where a is a positive integer
- estimation of the gradient of a curve by drawing a tangent
