# Mesh Analysis

Applying KVL and simultaneous equations to solve for unknown currents in a circuit.

## Overview

> Definition: Mesh: A closed loop of a network that does not contain any sub-loops

## Steps to use Mesh Analysis

The steps are:
1. Assign a DISTINCT current in the *clockwise* direction for each mesh of the network
2. Indicate the polarities of voltage drop across each resistor, for each mesh (the direction may be 
different for resistors that are shared between meshes)
3. Apply KVL to each mesh, and write the equations in terms of the mesh currents
4. Solve the equations simultaneously to find the mesh currents

Note that the current in a mesh is NOT the current through each resistor in the mesh. The current 
through a resistor in the mesh is the *sum of all currents of all meshes* that the resistor is in. From 
what I can tell, a given resistor can only be in 2 meshes due to the no-subloop rule.

## Example

In the example above, we have 2 meshes, with currents `$I_1$` and `$I_2$` in the clockwise direction. We 
can apply KVL to each mesh:
```math
\textrm{Mesh 1:} 
15 - 2I_1 - 3I_1 + 3I_2 + 20 = 0
15 - 5I_1 + 3I_2 = 0

\textrm{Mesh 2:}
20 - 3I_2 + 3I_1 - 2I_2 = 0
20 - 3I_2 + 3I_1 = 0
```

Note how for the 3 ohm resistor, the current is `$I_1 - I_2$` (with flipped signs for the other mesh) 
because it is in both meshes. You can then solve it with simultaneous equations.
