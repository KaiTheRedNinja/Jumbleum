## The Meaning of Citizenship

- Attributes can shape one’s understanding of citizenship
    - Legal status
        - Rights and obligations of citizens
    - A sense of identity
    - Shared values
    - Civic participation
        - Participate in public affairs as individuals and community groups

Generally, citizenship can be characterised as:
- More than a status grant by a country.
- A relationship that a person has with a country that they are a member of
- Can be understood differently by different people
- Can be understood differently over time

### Legal Status

Countries grant citizenship by legal status in different ways:
- **By country of birth**, where those born in the country are granted citizenship (eg. America)
- **By decent**, where a child of a citizen is granted citizenship (eg. Singapore)
- **By marriage**, where the spouse of a citizen is granted citizenship
- **By naturalisation**, where people who have moved to a country for a long time and applied for citizenship are granted it

Singapore grant and ship under all four of these categories. However, for citizenship by marriage, the spouse must first be a 
permanent resident of Singapore.

#### Rights of Citizens

Citizens enjoy certain **rights** as members of a country

> Definition: Rights: Freedoms and privileges that citizens in a country have

Rights of citizens, which are usually laid out in a constitution, are protected by law

#### Obligations of Citizens

Being a citizen of a country also means having obligations.

> Example: Under the enlistment act introduced in 1967, 18-year-old male citizens and Singapore permenant residents are required 
to serve national service (the army).

### Sense of Identity

> Definition: Identity: Your identity refers to how you perceive yourself and how you believe others perceive you

For example, these are some common identities associated with Singaporeans:
- Multiracial and multi religious society
- Local food and delicacies
- World class services
- Singlish
- HDB flats

Being a citizen usually means sharing a part of your identity with other members of the country

### Shared Values

Your understanding of citizenship can also be influenced by your interpretation and acceptance of the shared values 
held in your country

> Definition: Values: Principles and beliefs that influence a persons, attitude, thinking, and behaviour

> Definition: Shared Values: Values that are embraced or seen as important by a group of people

### Civic Participation

> Definition: Civic Participation: Citizens actively taking part in public affairs

Motivation participation is usually to address a societal issues, or help certain groups within a country.

There are several ways to participate in public affairs, such as:
- Participating as individuals, where individuals volunteer their time, effort and money in matters they are concerned without
- Participating in public affairs as community groups, where citizens with common interest organise themselves into groups to 
contribute towards specific needs of society
    - Informal Groups: Mr Nigel Teo And his friends started a mobile application called GoodHood.sg to promote neighbourliness in Singapore.
    - Formal Groups: Zero Waste Singapore is a non-government organisation leading the drive towards waste in Singapore through education and advocacy

## The Functions and Roles of Government

        - Implements and enforces laws
        - Interprets and applies laws
    - Roles of government
        - Maintains law and order

> Definition: Democracy: The ability of citizens to participate in political decision-making

The Singapore government is a representative democracy, meaning that the citizens elect representatives to make decisions on their behalf

### Functions of government

The Singapore Government serves three main functions:
- To make and pass laws (legislative)
- To implement and enforce laws (executive)
- To interpret and apply laws (judicial)

These functions are carried out by three branches of government.

There's a lot of stuff in the textbook about how the government makes and passes laws, except I don't think those are useful for 
our exams so I'm not going to write about them here

### Roles of government

As a government makes, passes, implements, enforces, interprets, and applies laws, its role in society is to:
- Maintain law and order: Preserve safety and security by ensuring that citizens, lives and properties are protected from harmful acts
    - Ensure justice is carried out
- Ensure economic and social well-being of citizens: Ensuring that individuals not only have their basic needs met, but also have the 
opportunity to pursue their goals, and enjoy a satisfactory quality of life
    - Polyclinics provide subsidised care
    - HDB does the same for 80% of the country's population
    - CPF is a savings system, where an employee, their employer, and the government all contribute to it. Foundation for the retirement 
    of most Singaporeans
- Promote and protect the country's national interest: Doing what is necessary to ensure a country's security and well-being
    - Ensuring economic growth
    - Ensuring a coutnry's population has sufficient food and water for survival
    - Ensuring that the country is safe from attacks by other countries

## How we Decide what is Good for Society

- Challenges in deciding what is good for society
    - Differing needs and interests
    - Differing priorities
    - Unequal sharing of costs
- Managing trade-offs
- Principles shaping governance
    - Having good leadership
    - Anticipating change and staying relevant
    - A stake for everyone, opportunities for all
    - Practising meritocracy

### Challenges in Deciding What is Good

There are generally two types of needs:
- Things that people depend on for their survival
- Things that people depend on for their well-being

People often share similar basic needs were survival. However, they may have different needs when it comes to well-being.

There are also different priorities for different groups of people. For example, commuters might benefit from the cross island line being 
implemented going through the central reserve. However, environmentalist oppose this as it would mean damaging parts of Singapore's largest 
nature reserve.

There is also unequal sharing of costs. For example, building expressway could improve traffic flow. However, it may come at the cost of 
those living near expressways or affected by the noise

Meritocracy is a system where opportunities and rewards are distributed according to merit

## Working Together for the Good of Society

- Addressing the needs of society
- Influencing decision-making in public affairs
- Strengthening citizens’ sense of belonging
