The paper that is really difficult because so many answers are wrong

## Overview

## Inference Questions

Notes based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkt6kRXeGJI).

> Format: "What do [words or phrase from the passage] suggest about [topic focus]?"

Usually one mark. The steps to answering the question is:
1. Identify the keywords and ideas
2. Understand the context, gather relevant clues
3. Craft your answer, rephrase the question, use clues

For example (2016 0 Level Section B):

> Example Source: He liked to see the food vendor's large silver truck park at the marina gates at precisely 6 am and enjoyed the smells 
of rice, of fresh pita, of beans cooked in garlic and of the best coffee in the world, all of which came wafting towards him out of the 
truck's windows. At 6.15 am, the truck's side would flip open and the local workmen, having queued there stoically, would scramble round 
for their breakfast, falling on the vendor's window like a pack of hungry wolves.

> Example Question: What do the words 'scramble' and 'falling on' suggest about the behaviour of the men?

1. Identify the keywords and ideas
    - Keywords: "scramble", "falling on". Means something along the lines of moving quickly, awkwardly, and in a disorganized manner.
    - Directive: "suggest" means that the words are used to imply something about the text
    - Focus: "behaviour of the men" means that the question is asking about the actions of the men
2. Understand the context, gather relevant
    - "at precisely 6am" and "6.15am" suggest that the workers have waited for at least 15 minutes
    - "queued there stoically" suggests that the workers are waiting in a calm and patient manner
    - "scramble round for their breakfast, falling on the vendor's window" suggests that the workers were rushing
    - "like a pack of hungry wolves" suggests that the workers were eager and aggressive, desperate for food
3. Craft your answer, rephrase the question, use clues
    - We know that:
        - They waited for at least 15 minutes
        - Moved awkwardly and quickly
        - Were desperate and hungry
    - "The words suggest that the men were rushing to get their breakfast in a desperate manner"

You don't need to explain the words, just state what they suggest. Remember to identify the connotations behind the points in the 
question, and make sure that each phrase is connected to every one of the points.

Remember not to use "and", because if one of the points is wrong, you will lose the mark. Keep inferences nice and short.

## Unusual Questions

Notes based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKSa0khFoU).

> Format: "What is unusual about [topic focus]?"

The way you answer it is by drawing a contrast between the topic and the rest of the passage. Usually, you would use two sentences,
where the first sentence is about the topic, and the second sentence is about the rest of the passage. For example:
- Question: What is Unusual about the narrator "looking for brooms" when it is about to rain?
- Answer:
    - First sentence: Brooms are **"usually"** used for cleaning and not to protect against rain.
    - Second sentence: **"However, in this case, it is unusual"** here because the narrator is looking for brooms instead of umbrellas when it is about to rain.

## Three Details Questions

Very similar to <doc:Language-Use>. The question will ask you to explain three details from the passage. The steps to answering the 
question is the same as inference.

Basically pick out three details from the passage. Note that these details may be in the same sentence or paragraph, and are usually no 
more than six words.
