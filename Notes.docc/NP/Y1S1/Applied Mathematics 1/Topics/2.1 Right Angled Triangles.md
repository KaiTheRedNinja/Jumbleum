# Right Angled Triangles

An introduction to trigonometry via right-angled triangles, its simplest application

## Overview

- Define trigonometric functions both in right-angled triangles and more generally
- Express angles in degrees
- Calculate all angles and sides of a right-angled triangle

## Definitions of Trig Functions

Let's take a right-angled triangle with angles `$A$`, `$B$`, and `$C$` where `$C$` is the right angle, and it has sides `$AB$`, `$BC$`, and `$AC$`.

The trigonometric functions are defined as follows:
```math
\sin(A) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{BC}{AC}
\cos(A) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{AB}{AC}
\tan(A) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{BC}{AB}
```

An easy way to remember these is the mnemonic "SOH-CAH-TOA"

See <doc:Trig-functions-identities-and-equations> for more details.

## Inverse Trig Functions

The inverse trigonometric functions are defined as follows:
```math
\sin(\rho) = x \implies \rho = \sin^{-1}(x)
\cos(\rho) = x \implies \rho = \cos^{-1}(x)
\tan(\rho) = x \implies \rho = \tan^{-1}(x)
```

Note that the `$\textrm{func}^{-1}$` notation is used to denote the inverse function, NOT the reciprocal.
Sometimes these are called the arc functions, e.g. `$\arcsin(x)$`, `$\arccos(x)$`, and `$\arctan(x)$`.

## Solving Right Angled Triangles

Just manipulate the equations above to find the unknown angles and sides.
