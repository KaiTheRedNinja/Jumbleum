# scanf and Data Types

How users input data and how data is stored in memory

## Overview

- Explain how `scanf()` reads user input
- Describe the characteristic of different data types
- Write simple C program to get user inputs

## scanf

`scanf` is a function used to read formatted input from the standard input (console). It is similar to `printf`, 
but the format specifier is used to specify the type of data being read.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int num;
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &num);
    printf("You entered: %d\n", num);
    return 0;
}
```

In the example above, `num` is passed to `scanf` using the address operator `&`. This is because `scanf` needs 
to know _where_ to store the input, and the `&` operator gives the address of the variable. Conceptually, the
`&` operator grants its consumer write access to the variable.

| Data Type | Usage | Example | Format Specifier | Notes |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------------|-------|
| `int` | Integer numbers | `42` | `%d` | |
| `float` | Floating point numbers | `3.14` | `%f` | Use `%.nf` to output to n decimal places |
| `char` | Characters | `'A'` | `%c` | When reading via `scanf`, use `" %c"` with a leading space to avoid reading the previous newline |
| `string` | Strings | `"Hello"` | `%s` | Strings have fixed lengths, you must define them large enough |

`scanf` technically allows you to read multiple values at once, with each format specifier separated by a space.

```c
scanf("%d %f %c", &age, &height, &initial);
```

## Data Types

Data types define how the data stored in memory is interpreted. The most common data types in C are:
- `int`: Integer numbers
- `float`: Floating point numbers
- `char`: Characters
- `double`: Double precision floating point numbers
- `bool`: Boolean values (true/false)

A varaible defined as an `int`, for example, can only store integer values. If you try to assign a 
floating point number to an `int` variable, it will result in a compile-time error.
