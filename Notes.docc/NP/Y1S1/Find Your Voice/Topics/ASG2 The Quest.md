# The Quest

Assessment 2: The Quest (40%)

## Overview

Group and individual assessment

## Brief

### Part 1: The Email

10% of your final grade

Think of a cause within your community worth advocating. It can be any topic that falls
within one of the categories below:

- a change you want to see in your community
- a group you want to advocate for
- a site you want to save from demolition
- a cultural practice you want to preserve
- a community movement you want to re-ignite

> Note: In choosing a cause, you should steer clear of sensitive topics that could be
> socially divisive, e.g. advocating for a cause along political, religious, racial lines, or
> where differences in personal values could lead to community tensions. If in doubt,
> please consult your tutor first.

#### Requirements

1. In your email, you need to persuade your tutor that your cause is worth advocating.
2. Conduct research and develop arguments using logos, ethos and pathos on why your
cause needs to be addressed.
3. Provide elaboration to show your reasoning and support your points with credible
evidence (e.g. local statistics, experts’ opinions, community observations, and/or
personal experiences).
4. Structure your email professionally with an appropriate subject, proper salutation
and well-developed body paragraphs.
5. Ensure your email is written clearly and concisely. Also, you must include a reference
list in APA style at the end (need 2. Citations DO NOT contribute to the word limit). 
There is no need to include in-text citations.
6. The word limit for this email is 250 words. Any content beyond the word limit will not
be assessed.
7. Use the email template that can be found on Brightspace or MS Teams files.

### Part 2: Online Discussion

5% of your final grade

Present your chosen cause to your teammates during an MS Teams meeting. The objective
of the meeting is to discuss the proposed causes and select *one cause* for your team’s
campaign.

#### Requirements

1. An MS Teams Meeting will be held on the day of your class in Week 11 (30 June to 4
July).
2. Your tutor will attend the meeting for about 25 minutes as a silent observer and will
assess your preparedness, participation, collaboration, and communication.
3. Ensure the position of your camera is appropriate and that your microphone is working
before the meeting.
4. During the meeting, take turns to present your chosen cause and the reasons for
choosing it. Support your reasons with the research findings from your email.
5. Additionally, you will be assigned to a team role (see below) before the meeting. Take
note of your two responsibilities and ensure that you carry them out
before/during/after the meeting as you will be assessed for this.

### Part 3: The Campaign

25% of your final grade

Create a campaign as a team to persuade a selected target audience to support the
campaign and take action.

Will be elaborated on later once parts 1 and 2 are completed.
