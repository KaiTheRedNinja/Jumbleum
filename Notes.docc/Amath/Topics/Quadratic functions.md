# Quadratic functions

Quadratic functions are polynomials with an x^2 term. Why they're called quadratic (quad = 4) and not bidratic is beyond me.

## Overview

Quadratic functions are surprisingly useful in real life. They can be used to model the trajectory of a projectile, the 
shape of a parabola, or the profit of a business. A lot of simple equations end up becoming quadratic equations if you
equate them.

## Different forms
Quadratic equations can be represented in three primary forms:
- Standard form: 
```math
y = ax^2 + bx + c
```
- Vertex form (aka complete-the-square form):
```math
y = a(x-h)^2 + k
```
- Factored form:
```math
y = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)
```
Where
- `a` is the coefficient of the x^2 term, which defines steepness and direction. If it is negative, its n shaped, 
else u shaped.
- `b` is the coefficient of the x term, which defines which way the slope tends towards. A negative value makes it move to the right, and a positive value makes it move to the left.
- `c` is the constant term. It defines the y-intercept.
- `h` is the x-coordinate of the vertex. It defines the horizontal shift, aka line of symmetry.
- `k` is the y-coordinate of the vertex. It defines the vertical shift, aka the minimum or maximum value of the function.
- `r_1` and `r_2` are the roots of the equation, aka the x-intercepts.
