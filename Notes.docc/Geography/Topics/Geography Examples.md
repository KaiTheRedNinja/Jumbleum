# Geography Examples

A collection of geography content examples, organised by chapter.

## Overview

Geography examples taken directly from the textbook. Not my textbook of course, I never bought one, I borrowed them from Michael.

Examples within geography are usually used for the final question, which is usually a nine mark question that requires you to balance
two factors. Basically what I'm saying is that you'll probably only ever need to use two of these examples in an exam.

Whenever they ask you to balance factors, It is almost always either stakeholder responsibility (such as whether the government or 
individuals are responsible for sustainable development), or effectiveness of measures (such as whether pro tourism is more effective 
than something else), or impact of factors (such as whether time of earthquake is the most influencial in determining impact). Because
of this focus on stakeholders and factors, these notes are highly focused on only those two. General examples are not mentioned here.

Note that examples that cover a subset of points that other examples cover are not included. For example, if a example covers points A, B, C 
and another one only covers A, B, the second example is not included.

## Geography in Everyday Life

No examples for this, because according to the marks scheme, GEL doesn't require you to provide your own examples.

## Tourism

### Tourism Activity

#### Motivation to Travel

    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Overdependence on tourism
    }

        - This may result in locals changing or diminishing their cultures to make it more sellable

        > Example: Canadian totem poles
        - These had been modified and are widely available as souvenirs
        - These are usually created without collaboration from native tribes

        - Tourist also do not respect indigenous Hawaiian culture

        > Example: Thai Kayan Lahwi women who wear neck rings
        - Many women feel exploited by the tourism industry
        - Because their communities are led on tourism revenue, the woman may have no choice, but let themselves be photographed 
        without permission

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {

    }
}

#### Sustainable Production of Tourism

    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Ensuring demands on ecosystem services do not exceed the supply of resources
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {

    }
}

        - Destination regions manage demands and responsible consumption by tourist
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Maya Bay, Thailand is very popular with tourists which resulted in the destruction of the coral reef 
        ecosystem due to pollution and trampling by tourists
        - In 2018, the beach was closed completely to allow it to recover
        - In 2022, the environment had recovered and it was reopened
    }
}

## Plate Tectonics

### Earthquakes

Tsunamis also included.

These two examples should cover almost any question on earthquakes.

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Lack of earthquake resistant buildings
        - Lacking resources
        - Bad soil conditions
        - Unable to self-organise
        - Disruption to basic services
        - Lack of manpower
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Haiti earthquake in 2010
        - Magnitude: Mw 7.0
        - Deaths: 220,000
        - Buildings destroyed: 250,000
        - Buildings were not earthquake resistant
            - Concrete pillars holding up buildings were not reinforced
            - More than 90% of buildings at the epicenter were destroyed
        - Haiti is a developing country with limited resources, which negatively impacted the recovery process
        - Large areas of Haiti have poor soil conditions, which amplified the shaking
        - There were no measures put in place to educate people on what to do during disasters
            - No network of healthcare workers, critical shortage of ambulances
            - Poor law enforcement
        - Water supply was disrupted, resulting in the International Committee of the Red Cross providing water for 12,000 people
        - Rescue team spent many hours manually removing rubble
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Earthquake resistant buildings
        - More resources
        - Long shake duration
        - Land use planning
        - Monitoring and early warning systems
        - Disaster prevention education programs
        - Timely evacuation
        - Rehousing efforts
        - Retro fitting infrastructure with hazard resistant features
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Tohoku, Japan earthquake and tsunami in 2011 
        - Magnitude: Mw 9.0
        - Deaths: 19,000 (notably lower than Haiti, despite a higher magnitude)
        - Duration: 6 minutes, far longer than the average earthquake. Caused a large amount of property damage. 
        - Buildings were earthquake-resistant due to Japan being more developed. 
        - Japan was in a far better position to recover from large tsunami damage due to their available resources.
        - houses on higher ground not destroyed by tsunamis due to good land use planning
            - After 1933 tsunami, Japan moved residential areas such as Touni-hongo village to higher ground
        - Monitoring and early warning systems detected strong tremors, and a signal was set out to stop the bullet trains
            - This saved thousands of lives
        - Nearly All of the 3000 students of Kamaishi city survived
            - Schools have disaster prevention education programs, hence they were able to respond quickly
        - Displaced about 500,000 people
            - By 2016, a majority were rehoused in settlements with enhanced tsunami resistant features
        - Level of new sites were raised by 10m and two sea walls were built
    }
}

Some redundant examples, just in case you need them:

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Earthquake resistant buildings
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Chile earthquake in 2010 
        - Magnitude: Mw 8.8 
        - Low building damage
        - Deaths: 500, very low
        - Buildings are modern and earthquake-resistant

        > Example: Taipei 101
        - Built in earthquake-prone Taiwan
        - It has a weight near the top to balance out ground shaking. This reduces the sway of the building and the threat of collapse.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Early morning earthquake
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Kobe, Japan earthquake in 1995
        - Magnitude: Mw 6.9 
        - Occurred in the early morning at around 6am. 
        - As many people were asleep, they were trapped at home, leading to more than 6,000 lives lost.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Search and rescue
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Aegean Sea, Turkey, 2020
        - Magnitude: Mw 7.0
        - 8000 search and rescue personnel were deployed
        - 106 people were rescued from the rubble
    }
}

### Volcanoes

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Large availability of surface and groundwater -> lahars
        - Unfavourable (fast) wind conditions
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Mount Pinatubo, Philippines (1991) 
        - Many lahars following the eruption
        - Triggered by heavy rain associated with the monsoon season
        - Buildings destroyed: 100,000 homes
        - Ashfall and tephra spreading a large distance due to fast wind speed (more than 20m/s).
        - More than 90,000 hectares of damaged farmland.
    }
}

@Row(numberOfColumns: 3) {
    @Column(size: 1) {
        - Good farming conditions
    }

    @Column(size: 2) {
        > Example: Mount Sinabung 
        - Active volcano in Indonesia
        - Several explosive eruptions of the volcano since 2010
        - Many continue to live and work within the restricted zone 3km from the volcano
        - This is due to the presence of fertile soils for farming.
    }
}
