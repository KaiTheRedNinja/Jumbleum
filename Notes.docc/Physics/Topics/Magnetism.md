Are you a magnet? Because the closer I get the more I'm attracted to you (and other bad pickup lines)

## Overview

- Laws of magnetism
- Magnetic properties of matter
- Magnetic field

## Magnets and Magnetic Materials

> Definition: Magnetic material: Materials that can be attracted by magnets

Magnetic materials include iron, cobalt, nickel, and their alloys. Lodestone and neodymium magnets are examples of permanent magnets.

## Properties of Magnets

- A freely suspended magnet always points in the north-south direction, due to the Earth's magnetic field.
- A magnet has two poles: north pole and south pole.
- The magnetic field is strongest at the poles.
- The poles of a magnet always come in pairs
    - If a magnet is broken into two, each piece will have a north pole and a south pole.

## Identifying Magnets

The only test for magnetism is **repulsion** between two magnets. Basically if you can position their poles so that they repel each other, 
both metals are magnets.

## Proximity Induced Magnetism

> Definition: Induced magnetism: When a magnetic material becomes a magnet when it is near or in contact with a magnet.

Magnetic properties are due to the arrangement of electrons within atoms
1. Magnets are made of atoms
2. The movement and arrangement of electrons in atoms create an atomic magnet
3. The magnetic domain consists of a group of atoms with their magnetic fields aligned in the same direction
4. In an unmagnetized material, the magnetic domains are randomly oriented so there is no net magnetic field
5. When a magnet is brought near the material, the magnetic domains align with the magnetic field of the magnet
6. The material becomes an induced magnet

Note that magnetic attraction is actually due to induced magnetism.
1. A magnet induces magnetism in a magnetic material
2. Because unlike poles attract, the induced magnet is attracted to the magnet

## Magnetisation of Magnetic Materials

1. Magnetism by stroking: Rubbing a magnetic material with a magnet in the same direction, to align the magnetic domains
2. Using a solenoid

Solenoids are coils of wire that produce a magnetic field when a current flows through them. When a magnetic material is placed inside a solenoid, 
the magnetic domains align with the magnetic field produced by the solenoid.

You can identify the direction of the magnetic field produced by a solenoid using the right-hand grip rule, where your fingers represent the 
direction of current in the coil and your thumb represents the direction of the magnetic field.

## Demagnetisation of Magnetic Materials

1. Heating: Heating a magnet causes the magnetic domains to lose alignment
2. Hitting: Hitting (or dropping) a magnet causes the magnetic domains to lose alignment
3. Alternating current: Passing an alternating current through a solenoid causes the magnetic field to change direction rapidly, which causes the magnetic
domains to lose alignment

## Temporary and Permanent Magnets

> Definition: Permanent magnet: A magnet that does not require the presence of an electric current or permanent magnetic field to retain their magnetism
> Definition: Temporary magnet: A magnet that retains its magnetism, only in the presence of an electrical field of permanent magnetic field

There are two types of ferromagnetic materials, "hard" and "soft" magnetic materials. These do not refer to the hardness of the materials, but to the ability 
of the material to become magnetised, and remain magnetised

| Property | Hard magnetic material | Soft magnetic material |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ease of magnetisation | Difficult | Easy |
| Retention of magnetism | Retains magnetism | Loses magnetism easily |
| Used for | Magnetic recording, fridge magnets | Electromagnets, transformer/solenoid cores |

## Magnetic Field

Very similar to <doc:Static-Electricity#Electric-Field>

> Definition: Magnetic field: A region where a magnetic material experiences a magnetic force.

These can be visualised in two ways:
1. Sprinkling iron filings around a magnet, which will align with the magnetic field lines
2. Using a compass, which will align with the magnetic field lines

Usually when we depict magnetic fields, we show them as **magnetic field lines**. These are imaginary lines that show the direction of the magnetic field at 
any point in space, where the density of the lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field.

These lines are directional, and always point from the north pole to the south pole. They are also continuous, and do not intersect.
