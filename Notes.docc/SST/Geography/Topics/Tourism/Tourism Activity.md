The nature of tourism

## Overview

- What is a tourism system
    - Components of the tourism system
        - key components include tourist generating regions, tourist destination regions and transit routes
        - volume and direction of travel between regions are influenced by transit routes
    - Relationship between tourist generating and destination regions
        - push factors at tourist generating regions and pull factors at tourist destination regions
        - interdependence of tourists, businesses and organisations at tourist generating and destination regions
    - Interactions between tourism and the environment
        - tourism activity interacts with nature, communities and economies in their local environment and beyond
        - changes to one part of the tourism system affects the local and wider environment, and vice versa
- What led to the growth of tourism
    - Motivation to travel
        - individuals seeking relaxation, self-fulfilment and unique travel experiences
        - made possible by growth in individuals’ incomes
    - Ability to travel
        - growth in disposable incomes and increased leisure time due to paid vacation.
        - facilitated by business innovations, lower transport costs and accommodation costs
    - Mobility in travel
        - expansion of public transport services and infrastructure, and new modes of air, land and sea travel
        - increased private car ownership improving travel convenience to nearby locations
- How do tourist destination regions develop over time
    - Exploration and involvement stages
        - small number of tourists undertaking individual and irregular travel to visit the destination’s primary attractions
        - locals offer tourist services, advertising the destination, requesting for more public tourist amenities and facilities
    - Development and consolidation stages
        - increase in tourist numbers with destinations having more man-made attractions, advertisements and foreign labour
        - growth in tourist numbers slow and tourists outnumber locals resulting in a tourism dependent economy
    - Stagnation and decline or rejuvenation stages
        - tourist numbers peak as a destination’s carrying capacity is reached, resulting in negative impacts
        - tourist numbers decline as a destination loses its tourist appeal or is rejuvenated with new cultural or man-made attractions
- How do different personality characteristics of tourists affect their travel choices
    - Spectrum of personality characteristics
        - Dependables and Venturers, with a small proportion of tourists on both extreme ends
        - majority of tourists in the middle of the spectrum with a mixture of both extremes
    - Features of personality characteristics
        - Dependables spend cautiously, guided by authoritative figures, prefer structure in daily living and the company of friends and family
        - Venturers spend readily, guided by personal judgement, prefer different activities and being alone
    - Personality characteristics influence travel patterns
        - different types of tourist destination regions appeal to tourists with different personality characteristics
        - tourists who are more Venturer types influence travel decisions of those who are more Dependable types

## Butler Model

1. Exploration: Small number of tourists who are more venturer type
2. Involvement: Locals offer tourist services, advertising the destination, start to develop the area for tourism
3. Development: Sharp increase in tourist numbers, large focus on development
4. Consolidation: Tourists outnumber locals, tourism dependent economy
5. Stagnation: Tourist numbers peak. Because there is no perceived growth, investment may stagnate
6. Decline: Tourist numbers decline as the destination loses its appeal
7. Rejuvenation: Destination is rejuvenated (usually by renovations)
