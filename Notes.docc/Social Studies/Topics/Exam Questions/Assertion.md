# Assertion

## Overview
Format: "'[some statement]'. Using the sources in this case study, explain how far you would agree with the statement"

Write FOUR paragraphs, in an `ADAD` format where `A` is agree and `D` is disagree.

Categorise sources into agree/disagree. You are allowed to use a source in both agree and disagree paragraphs, but 
make sure that they are in different paragraphs. Do not use a visual source for both agree and disagree paragraphs.

Do NOT write a summary paragraph. It isn't worth the risk because its not very mark-rich and time is tight.

Use BSA
- Because of [summary of what source said]
- So [connection inference ]
- As a result, [link to statement]
