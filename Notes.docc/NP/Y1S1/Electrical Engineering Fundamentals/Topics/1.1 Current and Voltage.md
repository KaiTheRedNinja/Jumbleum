# Current and Voltage

Ch 1.1: Current and Voltage basics

## Overview

Objectives of this subchapter:
- Define an atom and sketch a diagram to show the atom and its constituent parts
- Define electric current flow
- Define potential, potential difference, and electromotive force (emf)

## Atoms and their Structure

| Component | Charge | Mass (kg) | Location |
| --------- | ------ | --------- | -------- |
| Proton    | +1     | 1.67e-27  | Nucleus  |
| Neutron   | 0      | 1.67e-27  | Nucleus  |
| Electron  | -1     | 9.11e-31  | Shells   |

Note that electrons are usually drawn in "orbits", like planets. This is an inaccurate model because 
of quantum physics, but it is a useful model because it helps visualize the atom.

### Conductivity

Extremely simplified, the conductivity of a material is determined by the number of free electrons in the material. Copper has one electron in its outer shell, which can easily move around, making it a good conductor.

## Current and Voltage

See <doc:Current-of-Electricity#Current> for more information on current, and <doc:Current-of-Electricity#Voltage> for more information on voltage.

Some definitions are different in NP and SST, so be careful. Here are the NP versions, with the differences pointed out:

> Definition: Potential Difference: The energy required to move a unit charge between two points in a circuit (SST is basically the same)

> Definition: Electromotive Force: The energy per unit charge produced by a voltage source (SST says "the whole circuit" instead of just a power source)

> Definition: Potential: The potential difference between a point in a circuit and the ground
