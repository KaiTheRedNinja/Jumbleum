When lines meet and form pretty (or not pretty) shapes

## Overview

- right, acute, obtuse and reflex angles
- vertically opposite angles, angles on a straight line and angles at a point
- angles formed by two parallel lines and a transversal: corresponding
- angles, alternate angles, interior angles
- properties of triangles, special quadrilaterals and regular polygons (pentagon, hexagon, octagon and decagon), including symmetry properties
- classifying special quadrilaterals on the basis of their properties
- angle sum of interior and exterior angles of any convex polygon
- construction of simple geometrical figures from given data using compasses, ruler, set squares and protractors, where appropriate
