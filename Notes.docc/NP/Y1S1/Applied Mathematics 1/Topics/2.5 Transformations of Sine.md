# Transformations of Sine

Modifying the base sine function

## Overview

A sine function can be transformed in four ways:
- **Vertical translation**: moving the graph up or down
- **Horizontal translation**: moving the graph left or right
- **Amplitude stretch**: stretching or compressing the graph vertically
- **Period stretch**: stretching or compressing the graph horizontally

Reflections can be accomplished by using negative values for the amplitude or period.

## Generic Transformation

The generic transformation of a sine function is given by the formula:
```math
y = \textrm{amplitude} \sin(\textrm{frequency}(x - \textrm{xoffset})) + \textrm{yoffset}

\textrm{or}

y = a \sin(b(x - c)) + d
```
where:
- `$amplitude$` or `$a$` is the vertical stretch, where the resultant graph has an amplitude of `$|a|$` 
and vertical range of `$2|a|$`
- `$frequency$` or `$b$` is the horizontal stretch, where the period of the graph is given by 
`$\frac{2\pi}{|b|}$`
- `$xoffset$` or `$c$` is the horizontal translation, where the graph is moved to the right by `$c$` units
- `$yoffset$` or `$d$` is the vertical translation, where the graph is moved up by `$d$` units

## Drawing Transformed Sine Graphs

My procedure is:
1. Determine the y-offset of the graph
2. Draw a dotted line at the y-offset
3. Determine the amplitude of the graph, and therefore the maximum and minimum y values
4. Draw two dotted lines at the maximum and minimum y values
5. Determine the x-offset of the graph, and therefore where the graph starts
6. Draw the first point at `$(xoffset, 0)$` (for a sine graph. For cosine, draw it at `$(xoffset, amplitude)$`)
7. Determine the period of the graph
8. Draw points every `$period/4$` units along the x-axis. 
   - The first point is at `$(xoffset, 0)$`
   - The second point is at `$(xoffset + period/4, amplitude)$`
   - The third point is at `$(xoffset + period/2, 0)$`
   - The fourth point is at `$(xoffset + 3*period/4, -amplitude)$`
   - The fifth point is at `$(xoffset + period, 0)$`
9. Draw through the points
