## Source Based Question

When answering source based questions, always remember to:

1. Analyse the question requirements
    - Pay attention to the **specific requirements** of the question and answer directly.
2. Repeat the question focus
    - Restate the question focus in your answer to convince the marker that you're answering the question
3. Take a firm stand
    - If the question requires you to take a stance, do it **AT THE START OF THE ANSWER**
    - Do NOT use vague words like "to a large extent". You either agree or disagree.
4. Highlight ideas based on the big question
    - The key ideas (eg. the inference in an inference question) usually answer an aspect of the big 
    question
    - Use the big question to determine the main point of the source
5. Fully explain your logic
    - Any leaps of logic will be marked down. Make sure to explain your reasoning fully, for example:
        - "this makes the base source reliable, and hence it is usefulâ€¦"
        - "because of X, so Y, and as a result Z" (BSA)
6. If an SBQ doesn't seem to match any of the common SBQ types, see which one its most like and follow 
that structure
    - Make sure that your answer isn't overly formulaic
