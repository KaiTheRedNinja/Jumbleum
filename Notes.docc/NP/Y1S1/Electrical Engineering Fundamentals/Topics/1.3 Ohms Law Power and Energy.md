# Ohm's Law, Power, and Energy

Some basic formulae

## Overview

See <doc:Current-of-Electricity#Ohm's-Law> for Ohm's law. In summary, it relates resistance, current, and voltage:
```math
V = I*R
```

See <doc:Current-of-Electricity#Power> for power. In summary, it is a measure of energy used per second
```math
P = V*I = I^2*R = \frac{V^2}{R} = \frac{W}{t} = \frac{Q*V}{t}
```

Energy is simply power multiplied by time:
```math
E = P*t
```
