# Data Corruption

Data corruption occurs when computer data is made unusable by errors or alterations

## Effects of Corruption and Data Loss
If the corrupted data cannot be recovered/replaced, this results in **data loss**. The effects vary depending on 
the amount of corrupted data and type of data that is represented.

If the corrupted data is not needed to read other data, only that data itself is lost. This is more likely 
if the amount of corrupted data is small.

However, if the corrupted data is related to other data in the computer, then both itself and its related data 
may be lost, as it may contain information required to read/interpret the related data. This is more likely 
if the amount of corrupted data is large.

## Causes and Prevention
In all cases, making regular backups (copies of data made in case the original is damaged or lost) of data will 
help to prevent the loss of data. Causes of data corruption and loss include:

- Human error
    - Causes:
        - Storage devices may be damaged during transport.
        - Multiple users working on the same file may accidentally overwrite each other.
    - Preventive measures:
        - Make regular backups of data.
        - Use adequate protection when transporting storage devices.
        - Set up rules when collaborating with multiple users to prevent them from writing to the same file at the same time.
- Power failure
    - Causes:
        - If the power supply to a computer fails, data in the process of being written to a storage device may become corrupted and data stored in volatile memory and not yet written to a storage device will be lost.
    - Preventive measures:
        - Regular backups
        - Set up a backup power supply, or uninterruptible power supply (UPS) so storage devices can complete any write operations in case of a power failure.
- Hardware failure/damage.
    - Causes:
        - All magnetic, optical and solid-state storage devices can fail, either
        - due to overuse, manufacturing defects, or age. 
    - Preventive measures:
        - Regular backups
        - Check storage device regularly and replace them immediately when signs of failure are detected.
- Malware/viruses
    - Causes:
        - Some malware may purposely damage and corrupt data as a way of attacking the computer.
    - Preventive measures:
        - Regular backups
        - Avoid opening emails/attachments or files from unknown sources.
        - Install and configure a firewall to prevent malware from spreading through the network.
        - Install anti-virus and anti-spyware software and perform regular scans and updates.
