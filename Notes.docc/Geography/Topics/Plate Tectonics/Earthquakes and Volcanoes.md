## Different Types of Volcano

There are two different types of volcano: Stratovolcano (sharp, tall, explosive) and Shield 
volcano (blunt, short, mild)

They have different properties:

| Property | Shield | Strato |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Explosion strength | 😔 Mild | 💪 Strong |
| Height | ⬇️ Short | ⬆️ Tall |
| Shape | ⚪ Dome | ▲ Spike |
| Slope | 🎩 Gentle | 🔪 Steep |
| Viscoscity | ⬆️ Higher | ⬇️ Lower |

### Reason for Differences

Note that whenever we compare the different volcanoes, link it back to viscosity and eruption strength.

Shield volcanoes have lower viscosity lava, due to the low silica content, which allows the lava to flow easily. In 
contrast, stratovolcanoes have higher viscosity lava, due to the high silica content, which does not flow easily and 
builds up around the vent.

**Formation**: Shield volcanoes are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava, which flows easily and
spreads out over a wide area. This creates a wide, flat volcano with gentle slopes. In contrast,
stratovolcanoes are formed by the eruption of high-viscosity lava, which does not flow easily and
builds up around the vent. This creates a tall, steep volcano with a spike shape.

**Eruption strength**: Shield volcanoes have mild eruptions because the low-viscosity lava flows easily
and does not build up pressure. In contrast, stratovolcanoes have strong eruptions because the
high-viscosity lava does not flow easily and builds up pressure.

**Location**: Shield volcanoes are found at divergent plate boundaries, where tectonic plates are moving
apart (less silica, less viscous). In contrast, stratovolcanoes are found at convergent plate boundaries, 
where tectonic plates are colliding (crust melts as it subducts, therefore more silica, more viscous).

### Formation Process: Shield Volcano
Shield volcanoes are formed at C-C divergent boundaries, under similar conditions to block mountains.

1. As the core melts the mantle, heated magma rises to beneath the crust and spreads sideways, resulting in divergent boundaries
2. As continental plates diverge, fractures are formed in the rock layers
3. Reduction of pressure on underlying mantle causes mantle to melt into magma
4. Magma then rises through weak spots/fault lines in the crust to form volcanoes, through repeated eruptions

### Formation Process: Stratovolcano
Stratovolcanoes are formed at C-C convergent boundaries, under similar conditions to fold mountains.

1. As the oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate, the pressure squeezes out the water
2. This water reduces the melting point of the mantle, causing it to melt into magma
3. Magma then rises through weak spots/fault lines in the crust to form volcanoes, through repeated eruptions
