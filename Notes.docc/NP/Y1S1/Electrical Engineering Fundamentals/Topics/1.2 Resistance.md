# Resistance

Resistors, but a bit more advanced than secondary school

## Overview

See <doc:Resistors> for the following:
- General info
- Resistivity
- Types of resistors
- Colour code
- Effective resistance (across series and parallel circuits)

This document will instead focus on NP-specific topics, such as:
- Temperature coefficient
- Conductance

## Temperature Coefficient

For conductors, the resistance increases with temperature. This is because the atoms in the conductor 
vibrate more at higher temperatures, making it harder for electrons to flow through.

We generally aproximate this as a linear relationship, where the resistance at a given temperature is 
equal to the resistance at 20°C
```math
R_2 = R_1 (1 + \alpha (t_2 - t_1))
```
where:
- `R_1` is the resistance at temperature `t_1`, in ohms
- `R_2` is the resistance at temperature `t_2`, in ohms
- `$α$` is the temperature coefficient of resistance, which is a measure of how much the resistance 
changes with temperature, in ohms per degree Celsius (Ω/°C) or per Kelvin (Ω/K)
- `t_1` is the reference temperature (usually 20°C)
- `t_2` is the temperature at which we want to find the resistance

## Conductance

> Conductance: The ability of a material to conduct electricity, measured in siemens (S). It is the 
reciprocal of resistance.

```math
G = \frac{1}{R}
```
where:
- `$G$` is the conductance, in siemens (S)
- `$R$` is the resistance, in ohms (Ω)
