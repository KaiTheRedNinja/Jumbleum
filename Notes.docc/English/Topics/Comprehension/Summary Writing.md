Part of Paper 2, basically summarise the given text in under 80 words

## Overview

Summary writing 
- Identify the points
- Identify which points can be combined
- Write in your own words
- Organise in a coherent manner

Usually, the summary question will give you a specific subsection of the text to summarise.

## Structure

For example, "Summarise the appearance and behaviour of penguins _on land, and in the water_"

### Requirements

The question will specify what you need to summarise. Usually, it will have at least TWO requirements.
You MUST address all the requirements to get full (or even good) marks.

For example, the question above specifies that we talk about the following:
- Appearance of penguins
- Behaviour of penguins
- On land
- In the water

Which results in the following groups:
- Appearance of penguins on land
- Behaviour of penguins on land
- Appearance of penguins in the water
- Behaviour of penguins in the water

Note that you do not need to hit all the groups, because not all groups may exist. However, you must 
hit all the requirements individually. For example, if you hit these points:
- Appearance of penguins on land
- Behaviour of penguins on land
- Appearance of penguins in the water

Its usually sufficient, because you hit every single requirement.

### Marks

Marks scheme:
- 8 marks for content, one for each point
- 7 marks for language
    - Use your own words throughout the paragraph
    - Organise your ideas well, convey meaning and text precisely

## Common errors

- Repitition of the same point
- Disjoint points (no link between them)
- Answering wrong part of the text, or only part of the qn (e.g. only on land, not in water)

## Identifying points

There are always TEN points within the passage. Try to identify at least 10, because it is likely
that at least one will be wrong. You only need 8 correct points to get full marks for content.

The way you should identify points is by underlining or circling them in the passage. Highlight
any points that may seem remotely important; we filter them later.

> Warning: Do NOT use highlighters in the exam

### Filtering points

Once you have a list of points, identify if any of them do NOT fit into the requirements. For example:
- ✅ Awkward looking animal
- ✅ Bones of wings are flat and thin (flat/thin is part of appearance)
- ❌ Helps with heat conservation (not about appearance or behaviour)
- ❌ Standing erect - they spread their webbed toes so that their heels are above ther toes (detail about 
how they stand erect)
- ❌ Sit with their heels and their tail ends touching the ground (details about how they sit)
- ❌ Most of their leg bones are enveloped by their bodies (how they insulate their legs)

Details vs points is a very important distinction. Details are usually specific examples or explanations
of points, and are not usually required in a summary. Points are usually general statements about the
topic.

### Joining points

We join points to make better use of our words. Usually, you can combine points if they talk abou the
same thing. For example:
- Awkward looking animal
- Long bodies on short legs
- Shoulders set low on their bodies
Are all talking about how penguins look weird. Similarly,
- Squat, they become almost round
- Stand up straight, they appear slim, tall, and elegant
Are both talking about how penguins look different when they deviate from their normal posture.

## Rephrasing

You should ALWAYS 
- adjust the sentence structure

You should TRY TO
- rephrase adjectives (do NOT change the meaning)

You should NOT
- rephrase nouns

| Original | Rephrased | Change |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Awkward looking animal | Weird looking animal | Changed adjective |
| Long bodies on short legs, shoulders set low on their bodies | Have disproportionate long bodoes, short legs, and low shoulders | Changed sentence structure |
| Squat, they become almost round | Penguins become round when squatting | Changed sentence structure |
| Stand up straight, they appear slim, tall, and elegant | Tall and elegant while upright | Changed sentence structure, replaced "stand up straight" with "upright" |

## Coherency

For example:

> Good Example: When penguins are on land, they are often seen to have elongated bodies, short legs, and low shoulders.
They have boomerang like wings because of their flat and thin bones. They become round when squatting. They become
tall and elegant when upright. They have two stubby legs sticking out below their bellies when seated. They waddle
with a rolling, rotating gait.

This paragraph has two main issues:
1. No connectors
2. Repetition of "they"

To fix the first issue, we can use connectors like "Moreover", "Furthermore", "In addition", etc. but ONLY after two
or more points.

To fix the second issue, we can specify exactly which part of the penguin we are talking about, like "their wings".

> Bad Example: When penguins are on land, they are often seen to have elongated bodies, short legs, and low shoulders.
*Their wings* resemble a boomerang because of their flat and thin bones. *Furthermore*, they become round when
squatting and tall and elegant when upright. *In addition*, they have two stubby legs sticking out below their bellies
when seated. They waddle with a rolling, rotating gait.
