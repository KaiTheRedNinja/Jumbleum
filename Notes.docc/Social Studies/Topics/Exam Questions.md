## Message

## Similarity

## Evidence
Format: "How useful is Source X as evidence for [question focus]? Explain your answer."

Cross reference:
- Point: "Source X is useful as evidence for [question focus] *because it is reliable*, as Source Y corroborates it"
- Inference: "Source X states that [question focus] is [your inference], as seen in [quote from source]"

Highler level analysis:
- Point: "Source X is useful as evidence for [question focus] *because it is reliable*, as the author provides a 
balanced perspective on [question focus]"
- Positive: "The author points out [question focus] is [positive term], which can be seen by [quote from source]"
- Negative: "The author is even-handed, as they point out [question focus] is [negative term], which can be seen 
by [quote from source]"

Make sure that all sources used to corroborate/contradict your point match the question focus.

## Assertion
Format: "'[some statement]'. Using the sources in this case study, explain how far you would agree with the statement"

Write FOUR paragraphs, in an ADAD format where A is agree and D is disagree.

Categorise sources into agree/disagree. You are allowed to use a source in both agree and disagree paragraphs, but 
make sure that they are in different paragraphs. Do not use a visual source for both agree and disagree paragraphs.

Do NOT write a summary paragraph. It isn't worth the risk because its not very mark-rich and time is tight.

Use BSA
- Because of [summary of what source said]
- So [connection inference ]
- As a result, [link to statement]
