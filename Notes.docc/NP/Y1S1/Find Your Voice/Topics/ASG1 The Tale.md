## Storytelling Devices and Strategies

A story has four mandatory elements:
- "Hero" - the protagonist and main character. Here, this is you.
- "Hero's Goal" - the objective of the story. What do you want to achieve?
- "Villain" - the antagonist, might not be a person. Needs to be overcome to achieve the goal.
- "Conflict" - the struggle between the hero and the villain. This is the main part of the story.

### Anatomy of a Story

Literally just the "plot mountain".
1. *Orientation*
    - Where/when is the story set?
    - Who is the "hero" and "villain"?
2. *Conflict*
    - What does the hero want?
    - What is keeping them from getting it?
3. *Rising Action*
    - How does the conflict escalate?
    - How do things get *worse* for the hero?
4. *Climax*
    - How does the conflict reach its peak?
    - Make it clear how and why the hero must confront the villain.
5. *Falling Action*
    - The confrontation between the hero and villain.
6. *Resolution*
    - To what extent is the protagonist successful?
    - What does the hero learn?
    - How do they change as compared to the beginning?

The goal is to persuade the audience to take action based on your story
